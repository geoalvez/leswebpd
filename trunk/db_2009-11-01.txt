Taking a practice test under timed conditions\r\nhelps you to estimate the amount of time you can afford to\r\nspend on each question in a section and to determine the\r\nquestion types on which you may need additional practice.\r\nSince the LSAT is a timed test, it is important to use your\r\nallotted time wisely. During the test, you may work only\r\non the section designated by the test supervisor. You\r\ncannot devote extra time to a difficult section and make up\r\nthat time on a section you find easier. In pacing yourself,\r\nand checking your answers, you should think of each\r\nsection of the test as a separate minitest.\r\nBe sure that you answer every question on the test.\r\nWhen you do not know the correct answer to a question,\r\nfirst eliminate the responses that you know are incorrect,\r\nthen make your best guess among the remaining choices.\r\nDo not be afraid to guess as there is no penalty for\r\nincorrect answers.\r\nWhen you take the sample test that follows, abide by all\r\nthe requirements specified in the directions and keep\r\nstrictly within the specified time limits. Work without a\r\nrest period. When you take an actual test you will have\r\nonly a short break—usually 10-15  minutes—after\r\nSECTION III. When taken under conditions as much like\r\nactual testing conditions as possible, the sample test\r\nprovides very useful preparation for taking the LSAT.\r\nOfficial directions for the four multiple-choice sections\r\nand the writing sample are included in this sample test so\r\nthat you can approximate actual testing conditions as you\r\npractice. To take the test:\r\nc110 Set a timer for 35 minutes. Answer all the questions in\r\nSECTION I. Stop working on that section when the 35\r\nminutes have elapsed.\r\nc110 Repeat, allowing yourself 35 minutes each for sections\r\nII, III, and IV.\r\nc110 Set the timer for 30 minutes, then prepare your\r\nresponse to the writing sample at the end of this test.\r\nc110 Refer to “Computing Your Score” on page 120 in this\r\nbook for instruction on evaluating your performance.\r\nAn answer key is provided for this purpose.\r\nHow This Sample Test Differs From an Actual LSAT\r\nThis sample test is made up of the scored sections and\r\nwriting sample from the actual disclosed LSAT administered\r\nin October 1996. However, it does not contain the extra,\r\nvariable section that is used to pretest new test items of one\r\nof the three question types. The three LSAT question types\r\nmay be in a different order in an actual LSAT than in this\r\nsample test. This is because the order of the question types\r\nis intentionally varied for each administration of the test.\r\nThe actual test contains section headers at the top of\r\neach page that are not included in this sample test.\r\nThe Writing Exercise\r\nTest takers are given 30 minutes to complete the brief writ-\r\ning exercise, which is not scored but is used by law school\r\nadmission personnel to assess writing skill. Read the topic\r\ncarefully. You will probably find it best to spend a few\r\nminutes considering the topic and organizing your\r\nthoughts before you begin writing. Do not write on a\r\ntopic other than the one specified. Writing on a topic of\r\nyour own choice is not acceptable.\r\nThere is no “right” or “wrong” position on the writing\r\nsample topic. Law schools are interested in how skillfully\r\nyou support the position you take and how clearly you\r\nexpress that position. How well you write is much more\r\nimportant than how much you write. No special\r\nknowledge is required or expected. Law schools are\r\ninterested in organization, vocabulary, and writing\r\nmechanics. They understand the short time available to\r\nyou and the pressure under which you are writing.\r\nConfine your writing to the lined area following the\r\nwriting sample topic. You will find that you have enough\r\nspace if you plan your writing carefully, write on every\r\nline, avoid wide margins, and keep your handwriting a\r\nreasonable size. Be sure that your handwriting is legible.\r\nScratch paper is provided for use during the writing\r\nsample portion of the test only. Scratch paper cannot be\r\nused in other sections of the LSAT.\r\nThe writing sample is photocopied and sent to law\r\nschools to which you direct your LSAT score.\r\nSome writing sample prompts, or variations of them,\r\nmay be given at more than one LSAT administration. A\r\ncollection of 50 representative writing sample prompts is\r\nincluded in LSAT:  The Official TriplePrep Plus, published\r\nby LSAC.\r\n88\r\nSECTION I\r\nTime—35 minutes\r\n25 Questions\r\nDirections: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some\r\nquestions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that\r\nis, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by\r\ncommonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,\r\nblacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.\r\n1. French divers recently found a large cave along the\r\ncoast of the Mediterranean Sea. The cave is accessible\r\nonly through an underwater tunnel. The interior of the\r\ncave is completely filled with seawater and contains\r\nnumerous large stalagmites, which are stony pillars\r\nthat form when drops of water fall repeatedly on a\r\nsingle spot on a cave floor, leaving behind mineral\r\ndeposits that accumulate over time.\r\nThe information above most strongly supports\r\nwhich one of the following?\r\n(A) The Mediterranean Sea was at a higher level in\r\nthe past than it is now.\r\n(B) The water level within the cave is higher now\r\nthan it once was.\r\n(C) The French divers were the first people who knew\r\nthat the tunnel leading to the cave existed.\r\n(D) There was once an entrance to the cave besides\r\nthe underwater tunnel.\r\n(E) Seawater in the Mediterranean has a lower\r\nmineral content now than it had when the\r\nstalagmites were being formed.\r\n2. A director of the Rexx Pharmaceutical Company argued\r\nthat the development costs for new vaccines that the\r\nhealth department has requested should be subsidized by\r\nthe government, since the marketing of vaccines\r\npromised to be less profitable than the marketing of any\r\nother pharmaceutical product. In support of this claim\r\nthe director argued that sales of vaccines are likely to be\r\nlower since each vaccine is administered to a patient\r\nonly once, whereas medicines that combat diseases and\r\nchronic illnesses are administered many times to each\r\npatient.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most weakens the\r\nsupport offered by the company director for the claim\r\nconcerning the marketing of vaccines?\r\n(A) Vaccines are administered to many more people\r\nthan are most other pharmaceutical products.\r\n(B) Many of the diseases that vaccines are designed\r\nto prevent can be successfully treated by\r\nmedicines.\r\n(C) Pharmaceutical companies occasionally market\r\nproducts that are neither medicines nor vaccines.\r\n(D) Pharmaceutical companies other than the Rexx\r\nPharmaceutical Company produce vaccines.\r\n(E) The cost of administering a vaccine is rarely\r\nborne by the pharmaceutical company that\r\nmanufactures that vaccine.\r\n3. Manager: Our new computer network, the purpose of\r\nwhich is to increase productivity, can be installed\r\nduring the day, which would disrupt our\r\nemployees’ work, or else at night, which would\r\nentail much higher installation charges. Since\r\nsaving money is important, we should have the\r\nnetwork installed during the day.\r\nThe manager’s argument assumes which one of the\r\nfollowing?\r\n(A) The monetary value of the network equipment\r\nwould not exceed the cost of having the\r\nequipment installed at night.\r\n(B) The monetary value of any productivity lost\r\nduring a daytime installation would be less\r\nthan the difference between daytime and\r\nnighttime installation costs.\r\n(C) A daytime installation would be completed by\r\nno larger a crew and would take the crew no\r\nmore time than would a nighttime installation.\r\n(D) Once the network has been installed, most of the\r\ncompany’s employees will be able to use it\r\nimmediately to increase their productivity.\r\n(E) Most of the company’s employees would be\r\nable to work productively while a daytime\r\ninstallation is in progress.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n89\r\n4. An ingredient in marijuana known as THC has been\r\nfound to inactivate herpesviruses in experiments. In\r\nprevious experiments researchers found that inactivated\r\nherpesviruses can convert healthy cells into cancer cells.\r\nIt can be concluded that the use of marijuana can cause\r\ncancer.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most seriously\r\nweakens the argument?\r\n(A) Several teams of scientists performed the various\r\nexperiments and all of the teams had similar\r\nresults.\r\n(B) The carcinogenic effect of THC could be\r\nneutralized by the other ingredients found in\r\nmarijuana.\r\n(C) When THC kills herpesviruses it weakens the\r\nimmune system, and it might thus diminish the\r\nbody’s ability to fight other viruses, including\r\nviruses linked to cancers.\r\n(D) If chemists modify the structure of THC, THC\r\ncan be safely incorporated into medications to\r\nprevent herpes.\r\n(E) To lessen the undesirable side effects of\r\nchemotherapy, the use of marijuana has been\r\nrecommended for cancer patients who are free of\r\nthe herpesvirus.\r\n5. Archaeologist: A large corporation has recently offered\r\nto provide funding to restore an archaeological site\r\nand to construct facilities to make the site readily\r\naccessible to the general public. The restoration will\r\nconform to the best current theories about\r\nhow the site appeared at the height of the ancient\r\ncivilization that occupied it. This offer should be\r\nrejected, however, because many parts of the site\r\ncontain unexamined evidence.\r\nWhich one of the following principles, if valid, justifies\r\nthe archaeologist’s argument?\r\n(A) The ownership of archaeological sites should not\r\nbe under the control of business interests.\r\n(B) Any restoration of an archaeological site should\r\nrepresent only the most ancient period of that\r\nsite’s history.\r\n(C) No one should make judgments about what\r\nconstitutes the height of another civilization.\r\n(D) Only those with a true concern for an\r\narchaeological site’s history should be involved\r\nin the restoration of that site.\r\n(E) The risk of losing evidence relevant to possible\r\nfuture theories should outweigh any advantages\r\nof displaying the results of theories already\r\ndeveloped.\r\n6. Besides laying eggs in her own nest, any female wood\r\nduck will lay an egg in the nest of another female wood\r\nduck if she sees the other duck leaving her nest. Under\r\nnatural nesting conditions, this parasitic behavior is\r\nrelatively rare because the ducks’ nests are well hidden.\r\nHowever, when people put up nesting boxes to help the\r\nducks breed, they actually undercut the ducks’\r\nreproductive efforts. These nesting boxes become so\r\ncrowded with extra eggs that few, if any, of the eggs in\r\nthose boxes hatch.\r\nThe statements above, if true, most strongly support\r\nwhich one of the following?\r\n(A) Female wood ducks will establish nests in nest\r\nboxes only when natural nesting sites are not\r\navailable.\r\n(B) Nesting female wood ducks who often see other\r\nfemale wood ducks are the most successful in\r\ntheir breeding efforts.\r\n(C) The nesting boxes for wood ducks have less space\r\nfor eggs than do natural nesting sites.\r\n(D) The nesting boxes would be more effective in\r\nhelping wood ducks breed if they were less\r\nvisible to other wood ducks than they currently\r\nare.\r\n(E) Nesting boxes are needed to supplement the\r\nnatural nesting sites of wood ducks because of\r\nthe destruction of much of the ducks’ habitat.\r\n7. The crux of creativity resides in the ability to\r\nmanufacture variations on a theme. If we look at the\r\nhistory of science, for instance, we see that every idea is\r\nbuilt upon a thousand related ideas. Careful analysis\r\nleads us to understand that what we choose to call a new\r\ntheme or a new discovery is itself always and without\r\nexception some sort of variation, on a deep level, of\r\nprevious themes.\r\nIf all of the statements in the passage are true, each of\r\nthe following must also be true EXCEPT:\r\n(A) A lack of ability to manufacture a variation on a\r\nprevious theme connotes a lack of creativity.\r\n(B) No scientific idea is entirely independent of all\r\nother ideas.\r\n(C) Careful analysis of a specific variation can reveal\r\nprevious themes of which it is a variation.\r\n(D) All great scientific discoverers have been able to\r\nmanufacture a variation on a theme.\r\n(E) Some new scientific discoveries do not represent,\r\non a deep level, a variation on previous themes.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n8. Millions of female bats rear their pups in Bracken Cave.\r\nAlthough the mothers all leave the cave nightly, on their\r\nreturn each mother is almost always swiftly reunited\r\nwith her own pup. Since the bats’ calls are their only\r\nmeans of finding one another, and a bat pup cannot\r\ndistinguish the call of its mother from that of any other\r\nadult bat, it is clear that each mother bat can recognize\r\nthe call of her pup.\r\nThe argument seeks to do which one of the following?\r\n(A) derive a general conclusion about all members of\r\na group from facts known about representative\r\nmembers of that group\r\n(B) establish the validity of one explanation for a\r\nphenomenon by excluding alternative\r\nexplanations\r\n(C) support, by describing a suitable mechanism, the\r\nhypothesis that a certain phenomenon can occur\r\n(D) conclude that members of two groups are likely to\r\nshare a certain ability because of other\r\ncharacteristics they share\r\n(E) demonstrate that a general rule applies in a\r\nparticular case\r\n9. Someone who gets sick from eating a meal will often\r\ndevelop a strong distaste for the one food in the meal\r\nthat had the most distinctive flavor, whether or not that\r\nfood caused the sickness. This phenomenon explains\r\nwhy children are especially likely to develop strong\r\naversions to some foods.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, provides the\r\nstrongest support for the explanation?\r\n(A) Children are more likely than adults to be given\r\nmeals composed of foods lacking especially\r\ndistinctive flavors.\r\n(B) Children are less likely than adults to see a\r\nconnection between their health and the foods\r\nthey eat.\r\n(C) Children tend to have more acute taste and to\r\nbecome sick more often than adults do.\r\n(D) Children typically recover more slowly than\r\nadults do from sickness caused by food.\r\n(E) Children are more likely than are adults to refuse\r\nto eat unfamiliar foods.\r\n10. Premiums for automobile accident insurance are often\r\nhigher for red cars than for cars of other colors. To\r\njustify these higher charges, insurance companies claim\r\nthat, overall, a greater percentage of red cars are\r\ninvolved in accidents than are cars of any other color. If\r\nthis claim is true, then lives could undoubtedly be saved\r\nby banning red cars from the roads altogether.\r\nThe reasoning in the argument is flawed because\r\nthe argument\r\n(A) accepts without question that insurance\r\ncompanies have the right to charge higher\r\npremiums for higher-risk clients\r\n(B) fails to consider whether red cars cost the same to\r\nrepair as cars of other colors\r\n(C) ignores the possibility that drivers who drive\r\nrecklessly have a preference for red cars\r\n(D) does not specify precisely what percentage of red\r\ncars are involved in accidents\r\n(E) makes an unsupported assumption that every\r\nautomobile accident results in some loss of life\r\n11. A certain credit-card company awards its customers\r\nbonus points for using its credit card. Customers can\r\nuse accumulated points in the purchase of brand name\r\nmerchandise by mail at prices lower than the\r\nmanufacturers’ suggested retail prices. At any given\r\ntime, therefore, customers who purchase merchandise\r\nusing the bonus points spend less than they would spend\r\nif they purchased the same merchandise in retail stores.\r\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which\r\nthe argument depends?\r\n(A) The merchandise that can be ordered by mail\r\nusing the bonus points is not offered at lower\r\nprices by other credit-card companies that award\r\nbonus points.\r\n(B) The bonus points cannot be used by the credit-\r\ncard customers in the purchase of brand name\r\nmerchandise that is not available for purchase in\r\nretail stores.\r\n(C) The credit-card company does not require its\r\ncustomers to accumulate a large number of\r\nbonus points before becoming eligible to order\r\nmerchandise at prices lower than the\r\nmanufacturers’ suggested retail price.\r\n(D) The amount credit-card customers pay for\r\nshipping the merchandise ordered by mail does\r\nnot increase the amount customers spend to an\r\namount greater than they would spend if they\r\npurchased the same merchandise in retail stores.\r\n(E) The merchandise available to the company’s\r\ncredit-card customers using the bonus points\r\nis frequently sold in retail stores at prices that are\r\nhigher than the manufacturers’ suggested retail\r\nprices.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n90\r\n91\r\n12. It is probably not true that colic in infants is caused by\r\nthe inability of those infants to tolerate certain antibodies\r\nfound in cow’s milk, since it is often the case that\r\nsymptoms of colic are shown by infants that are fed\r\nbreast milk exclusively.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most seriously\r\nweakens the argument?\r\n(A) A study involving 500 sets of twins has found\r\nthat if one infant has colic, its twin will probably\r\nalso have colic.\r\n(B) Symptoms of colic generally disappear as infants\r\ngrow older, whether the infants have been fed\r\nbreast milk exclusively or have been fed infant\r\nformula containing cow’s milk.\r\n(C) In a study of 5,000 infants who were fed only\r\ninfant formula containing cow’s milk, over\r\n4,000 of the infants never displayed any\r\nsymptoms of colic.\r\n(D) When mothers of infants that are fed only breast\r\nmilk eliminate cow’s milk and all products made\r\nfrom cow’s milk from their own diets, any colic\r\nsymptoms that their infants have manifested\r\nquickly disappear.\r\n(E) Infants that are fed breast milk develop mature\r\ndigestive systems at an earlier age than do those\r\nthat are fed infant formulas, and infants with\r\nmature digestive systems are better able to\r\ntolerate certain proteins and antibodies found in\r\ncow’s milk.\r\nQuestions 13–14\r\nYolanda: Gaining access to computers without\r\nauthorization and manipulating the data and\r\nprograms they contain is comparable to joyriding\r\nin stolen cars; both involve breaking into private\r\nproperty and treating it recklessly. Joyriding,\r\nhowever, is the more dangerous crime because it\r\nphysically endangers people, whereas only\r\nintellectual property is harmed in the case of\r\ncomputer crimes.\r\nArjun: I disagree! For example, unauthorized use of\r\nmedical records systems in hospitals could\r\ndamage data systems on which human lives\r\ndepend, and therefore computer crimes also\r\ncause physical harm to people.\r\n13. An issue in dispute between Yolanda and Arjun is\r\n(A) whether joyriding physically endangers human\r\nlives\r\n(B) whether the unauthorized manipulation of\r\ncomputer data involves damage to private\r\nproperty\r\n(C) whether damage to physical property is more\r\ncriminal than damage to intellectual property\r\n(D) whether the unauthorized use of computers is as\r\ndangerous to people as is joyriding\r\n(E) whether treating private property recklessly is\r\never a dangerous crime\r\n14. The reasoning in Arjun’s response is flawed because he\r\n(A) fails to maintain a distinction made in Yolanda’s\r\nargument\r\n(B) denies Yolanda’s conclusion without providing\r\nevidence against it\r\n(C) relies on the actuality of a phenomenon that he\r\nhas only shown to be possible\r\n(D) mistakes something that leads to his conclusion\r\nfor something that is necessary for his\r\nconclusion\r\n(E) uses as evidence a phenomenon that is\r\ninconsistent with his own conclusion\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n92\r\n15. A report of a government survey concluded that Center\r\nCity was among the ten cities in the nation with the\r\nhighest dropout rate from its schools. The survey data\r\nwere obtained by asking all city residents over the age of\r\n19 whether they were high school graduates and\r\ncomputing the proportion who were not. A city school\r\nofficial objected that the result did not seem accurate\r\naccording to the schools’ figures.\r\nThe school official can most properly criticize the\r\nreasoning by which the survey report reached its result\r\nfor failure to do which one of the following?\r\n(A) take into account instances of respondents’\r\ndropping out that occurred before the\r\nrespondents reached high school\r\n(B) ask residents whether they had completed their\r\nhigh school work in fewer than the usual number\r\nof years\r\n(C) distinguish between residents who had\r\nattended the city’s schools and those who had\r\nreceived their schooling elsewhere\r\n(D) predict the effect of the information contained in\r\nthe report on future high school dropout rates\r\nfor the city\r\n(E) consider whether a diploma from the city’s high\r\nschools signaled the same level of achievement\r\nover time\r\n16. Brown dwarfs—dim red stars that are too cool to burn\r\nhydrogen—are very similar in appearance to red dwarf\r\nstars, which are just hot enough to burn hydrogen. Stars,\r\nwhen first formed, contain substantial amounts of the\r\nelement lithium. All stars but the coolest of the brown\r\ndwarfs are hot enough to destroy lithium completely by\r\nconverting it to helium. Accordingly, any star found that\r\ncontains no lithium is not one of these coolest brown\r\ndwarfs.\r\nThe argument depends on assuming which one of the\r\nfollowing?\r\n(A) None of the coolest brown dwarfs has ever been\r\nhot enough to destroy lithium.\r\n(B) Most stars that are too cool to burn hydrogen\r\nare too cool to destroy lithium completely.\r\n(C) Brown dwarfs that are not hot enough to destroy\r\nlithium are hot enough to destroy helium.\r\n(D) Most stars, when first formed, contain roughly the\r\nsame percentage of lithium.\r\n(E) No stars are more similar in appearance to red\r\ndwarfs than are brown dwarfs.\r\n17. Whenever a company loses a major product-liability\r\nlawsuit, the value of the company’s stocks falls\r\nsignificantly within hours after the announcement. Cotoy\r\nhas long been involved in a major product-liability\r\nlawsuit, and its stocks fell significantly in value today.\r\nTherefore, we can be sure that an unfavorable judgment\r\nagainst Cotoy in that lawsuit was announced earlier\r\ntoday.\r\nWhich one of the following contains flawed reasoning\r\nthat most closely parallels that in the argument above?\r\n(A) Whenever a business treats its customers\r\ndiscourteously, its customers begin to shop\r\nelsewhere. Shopwell wants to keep all of its\r\ncustomers; therefore, its employees will never\r\ntreat customers discourteously.\r\n(B) Whenever the large airlines decrease fares, the\r\nfinancial stability of smaller competing airlines\r\nis adversely affected. Therefore, the smaller\r\ncompeting airlines’ financial stability must be\r\nseriously threatened when the large airlines\r\nannounce a large price decrease.\r\n(C) Whenever a country shows a lack of leadership\r\non international issues, respect for the country’s\r\npolicies begins to decline. Therefore, to gain\r\nrespect for its policies, a country should show\r\nleadership on international issues.\r\n(D) Whenever an entering student at Cashman\r\nCollege wins the Performance Fellowship, he or\r\nshe receives $10,000. Therefore, Eula, a student\r\nwho has enrolled at Cashman, must have won\r\nthe Performance Fellowship, because she just\r\nreceived $10,000 from the college.\r\n(E) Whenever a company advertises its products\r\neffectively, the company’s sales increase.\r\nOroco’s sales have not increased; therefore, it is\r\nlikely that the company did not advertise its\r\nproducts effectively.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n93\r\n18. In recent years the climate has been generally cool in\r\nnorthern Asia. But during periods when the average\r\ndaily temperature and humidity in northern Asia were\r\nslightly higher than their normal levels the yields of most\r\ncrops grown there increased significantly. In the next\r\ncentury, the increased average daily temperature and\r\nhumidity attained during those periods are expected to\r\nbecome the norm. Yet scientists predict that the yearly\r\nyields of most of the region’s crops will decrease during\r\nthe next century.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve\r\nthe apparent paradox in the information above?\r\n(A) Crop yields in southern Asia are expected to\r\nremain constant even after the average daily\r\ntemperature and humidity there increase from\r\nrecent levels.\r\n(B) Any increases in temperature and humidity would\r\nbe accompanied by higher levels of atmospheric\r\ncarbon dioxide, which is vital to plant\r\nrespiration.\r\n(C) The climate in northern Asia has generally been\r\ntoo cool and dry in recent years for populations\r\nof many crop insect pests to become established.\r\n(D) In many parts of Asia, the increased annual\r\nprecipitation that would result from warmer and\r\nwetter climates would cause most edible plant\r\nspecies to flourish.\r\n(E) The recent climate of northern Asia prevents\r\nmany crops from being farmed there during the\r\nwinter.\r\n19. No one in the French department to which Professor\r\nAlban belongs is allowed to teach more than one\r\nintroductory level class in any one term. Moreover, the\r\nonly language classes being taught next term are\r\nadvanced ones. So it is untrue that both of the French\r\nclasses Professor Alban will be teaching next term will\r\nbe introductory level classes.\r\nThe pattern of reasoning displayed in the argument\r\nabove is most closely paralleled by that in which one of\r\nthe following arguments?\r\n(A) The Morrison Building will be fully occupied by\r\nMay and since if a building is occupied by May\r\nthe new tax rates apply to it, the Morrison\r\nBuilding will be taxed according to the new\r\nrates.\r\n(B) The revised tax code does not apply at all to\r\nbuildings built before 1900, and only the first\r\nsection of the revised code applies to buildings\r\nbuilt between 1900 and 1920, so the revised\r\ncode does not apply to the Norton Building,\r\nsince it was built in 1873.\r\n(C) All property on Overton Road will be\r\nreassessed for tax purposes by the end of the\r\nyear and the Elnor Company headquarters is\r\non Overton Road, so Elnor’s property taxes\r\nwill be higher next year.\r\n(D) New buildings that include public space are\r\nexempt from city taxes for two years and all new\r\nbuildings in the city’s Alton district are exempt\r\nfor five years, so the building with the large\r\npublic space that was recently completed in\r\nAlton will not be subject to city taxes next year.\r\n(E) Since according to recent statute, a building that\r\nis exempt from property taxes is charged for\r\ncity water at a special rate, and hospitals are\r\nexempt from property taxes, Founder’s\r\nHospital will be charged for city water at the\r\nspecial rate.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n94\r\nQuestions 20–21\r\nSome people have been promoting a new herbal mixture\r\nas a remedy for the common cold. The mixture contains,\r\namong other things, extracts of the plants purple cone-\r\nflower and goldenseal. A cold sufferer, skeptical of the\r\nclaim that the mixture is an effective cold remedy, argued,\r\n“Suppose that the mixture were an effective cold remedy.\r\nSince most people with colds wish to recover quickly, it\r\nfollows that almost everybody with a cold would be using\r\nit. Therefore, since there are many people who have colds\r\nbut do not use the mixture, it is obviously not effective.”\r\n20. Each of the following is an assumption required by\r\nthe skeptical cold sufferer’s argument EXCEPT:\r\n(A) Enough of the mixture is produced to provide the\r\nrequired doses to almost everybody with a cold.\r\n(B) The mixture does not have side effects severe\r\nenough to make many people who have colds\r\navoid using it.\r\n(C) The mixture is powerful enough to prevent\r\nalmost everybody who uses it from\r\ncontracting any further colds.\r\n(D) The mixture is widely enough known that\r\nalmost everybody with a cold is aware of it.\r\n(E) There are no effective cold remedies available\r\nthat many people who have colds prefer to the\r\nmixture.\r\n21. Which one of the following most accurately describes\r\nthe method of reasoning the cold sufferer uses to\r\nreach the conclusion of the argument?\r\n(A) finding a claim to be false on the grounds that it\r\nwould if true have consequences that are false\r\n(B) accepting a claim on the basis of public opinion\r\nof the claim\r\n(C) showing that conditions necessary to establish\r\nthe truth of a claim are met\r\n(D) basing a generalization on a representative\r\ngroup of instances\r\n(E) showing that a measure claimed to be effective\r\nin achieving a certain effect would actually\r\nmake achieving the effect more difficult\r\n22. To hold criminals responsible for their crimes\r\ninvolves a failure to recognize that criminal actions,\r\nlike all actions, are ultimately products of the\r\nenvironment that forged the agent’s character. It is\r\nnot criminals but people in the law-abiding majority\r\nwho by their actions do most to create and maintain\r\nthis environment. Therefore, it is law-abiding people\r\nwhose actions, and nothing else, make them alone\r\ntruly responsible for crime.\r\nThe reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to\r\ncriticism on the grounds that\r\n(A) it exploits an ambiguity in the term\r\n“environment” by treating two different\r\nmeanings of the word as though they were\r\nequivalent\r\n(B) it fails to distinguish between actions that are\r\nsocially acceptable and actions that are socially\r\nunacceptable\r\n(C) the way it distinguishes criminals from crimes\r\nimplicitly denies that someone becomes a\r\ncriminal solely in virtue of having committed a\r\ncrime\r\n(D) its conclusion is a generalization of statistical\r\nevidence drawn from only a small minority of\r\nthe population\r\n(E) its conclusion contradicts an implicit principle on\r\nwhich an earlier part of the argument is based\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n95\r\n23. Chronic back pain is usually caused by a herniated or\r\ndegenerated spinal disk. In most cases the disk will\r\nhave been damaged years before chronic pain\r\ndevelops, and in fact an estimated one in five people\r\nover the age of 30 has a herniated or degenerated\r\ndisk that shows no chronic symptoms. If chronic pain\r\nlater develops in such a case, it is generally brought\r\nabout by a deterioration of the abdominal and spinal\r\nmuscles caused by insufficient exercise.\r\nThe statements above, if true, most strongly support\r\nwhich one of the following?\r\n(A) Four out of five people over the age of 30 can be\r\nsure they will never develop chronic back pain.\r\n(B) People who exercise their abdominal and spinal\r\nmuscles regularly are sure to be free from\r\nchronic back pain.\r\n(C) Patients rarely suffer even mild and fleeting\r\nback pain at the time that a spinal disk first\r\nbecomes herniated or degenerated.\r\n(D) Doctors can accurately predict which people\r\nwho do not have chronic back pain will\r\ndevelop it in the future.\r\n(E) There is a strategy that can be effective in\r\ndelaying or preventing the onset of pain from\r\na currently asymptomatic herniated or\r\ndegenerated spinal disk.\r\n24.

Yet his genius has never received its due. The\r\nimpatience and artistic restlessness that characterized\r\n(5) his work spawned one stylistic turn after another and\r\nmade Davis anathema to many critics, who deplored\r\nhis abandonment first of bebop and then of “cool”\r\nacoustic jazz for ever more innovative sounds.\r\nHaving begun his career studying bebop, Davis\r\n(10) pulled the first of many stylistic surprises when, in\r\n1948, he became a member of an impromptu musical\r\nthink tank that gathered in a New York City apartment.\r\nThe work of this group not only slowed down tempos\r\nand featured ensemble playing as much as or even\r\n(15) more than solos—in direct reaction to bebop—it also\r\nbecame the seedbed for the “West Coast cool” jazz\r\nstyle.\r\nIn what would become a characteristic zigzag,\r\nDavis didn’t follow up on these innovations himself.\r\n(20) Instead, in the late 1950s he formed a new band that\r\nbroke free from jazz’s restrictive pattern of chord\r\nchanges. Soloists could determine the shapes of their\r\nmelodies without referring back to the same unvarying\r\nrepetition of chords. In this period, Davis attempted to\r\n(25) join jazz phrasings, harmonies, and tonal qualities with\r\na unified and integrated sound similar to that of a\r\nclassical orchestral piece: in his recordings the\r\nrhythms, no matter how jazzlike, are always\r\nunderstated, and the instrumental voicings seem muted.\r\n(30) Davis’s recordings from the late 1960s signal that,\r\nonce again, his direction was changing. On Filles de\r\nKilimanjaro, Davis’s request that keyboardist Herbie\r\nHancock play electric rather than acoustic piano caused\r\nconsternation among jazz purists of the time. Other\r\n(35) albums featured rock-style beats, heavily electronic\r\ninstrumentation, a loose improvisational attack and a\r\ngrowing use of studio editing to create jagged\r\nsoundscapes. By 1969 Davis’s typical studio procedure\r\nwas to have musicians improvise from a base script of\r\n(40) material and then to build finished pieces out of tape,\r\nlike a movie director. Rock groups had pioneered the\r\nprocess; to jazz lovers, raised on the ideal of live\r\nimprovisation, that approach was a violation of the\r\npremise that recordings should simply document the\r\n(45) musicians’ thought processes in real time. Davis again\r\nbecame the target of fierce polemics by purist jazz\r\ncritics, who have continued to belittle his contributions\r\nto jazz.\r\nWhat probably underlies the intensity of the\r\n(50) reactions against Davis is fear of the broadening of\r\npossibilities that he exemplified. Ironically, he was\r\nsimply doing what jazz explorers have always done:\r\nreaching for something new that was his own. But\r\nbecause his career endured, because he didn’t die\r\n(55) young or record only sporadically, and because he\r\nrefused to dwell in whatever niche he had previously\r\ncarved out, critics find it difficult to definitively rank\r\nDavis in the aesthetic hierarchy to which they cling.\r\n1. Which one of the following best states the main point\r\nof the passage?\r\n(A) Because the career of Miles Davis was\r\ncharacterized by frequent shifts in styles, he\r\nnever fulfilled his musical potential.\r\n(B) Because the career of Miles Davis does not fit\r\nneatly into their preconceptions about the life\r\nand music of jazz musicians, jazz critics have\r\nnot accorded him the appreciation he deserves.\r\n(C) Because the career of Miles Davis was unusually\r\nlong and productive, he never received the\r\npopular acclaim generally reserved for artists\r\nwith more tragic life histories.\r\n(D) The long and productive career of Miles Davis\r\nspawned most of the major stylistic changes\r\naffecting twentieth-century jazz.\r\n(E) Miles Davis’s versatility and openness have\r\ninspired the admiration of most jazz critics.\r\n2. According to the passage, which one of the following\r\nis true of the “West Coast cool” jazz style?\r\n(A) It was popularized by Miles Davis.\r\n(B) It was characterized by a unified and integrated\r\nsound.\r\n(C) It was played primarily by large ensembles.\r\n(D) It introduced a wide variety of chord change\r\npatterns.\r\n(E) It grew out of innovations developed in New\r\nYork City.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n3. The passage suggests which one of the following about\r\nthe kind of jazz played by Miles Davis prior to 1948?\r\n(A) It was characterized by rapid tempos and an\r\nemphasis on solo playing.\r\n(B) It equally balanced ensemble and solo playing.\r\n(C) It was a reaction against more restrictive jazz\r\nstyles.\r\n(D) It is regarded by purist jazz critics as the only\r\nauthentic jazz style.\r\n(E) It was played primarily in New York City jazz\r\nclubs.\r\n4. Which one of the following best describes the author’s\r\nattitude toward Miles Davis’s music?\r\n(A) uneasy ambivalence\r\n(B) cautious neutrality\r\n(C) grudging respect\r\n(D) moderate commendation\r\n(E) appreciative advocacy\r\n5. Which one of the following creative processes is most\r\nsimilar to Miles Davis’s typical studio procedure of the\r\nlate 1960s, as described in the fourth paragraph of the\r\npassage?\r\n(A) The producer of a television comedy show\r\nsuggests a setting and general topic for a comedy\r\nsketch and then lets the comedians write their\r\nown script.\r\n(B) An actor digresses from the written script and\r\nimprovises during a monologue in order to\r\nintroduce a feeling of spontaneity to the\r\nperformance.\r\n(C) A conductor rehearses each section of the\r\norchestra separately before assembling them to\r\nrehearse the entire piece together.\r\n(D) An artist has several photographers take pictures\r\npertaining to a certain assigned theme and then\r\nassembles them into a pictorial collage.\r\n(E) A teacher has each student in a writing class\r\nwrite an essay on an assigned topic and then\r\nsubmits the best essays to be considered for\r\npublication in a journal.\r\n6. Which one of the following, if true, would\r\nmost undermine the author’s explanation for\r\nthe way Miles Davis is regarded by jazz critics?\r\n(A) Many jazz musicians who specialize in\r\nimprovisational playing are greatly admired\r\nby jazz critics.\r\n(B) Many jazz musicians whose careers have been\r\ncharacterized by several radical changes in style\r\nare greatly admired by jazz critics.\r\n(C) Several jazz musicians who perform exclusively\r\non electronic instruments are very highly\r\nregarded by jazz critics.\r\n(D) The jazz innovators who are held in the highest\r\nregard by jazz critics had brief yet brilliant\r\ncareers.\r\n(E) Jazz critics are known to have a higher regard for\r\nmusicality than for mere technical virtuosity.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n97\r\n98\r\nBy the mid-fourteenth century, professional\r\nassociations of canon lawyers (legal advocates in\r\nChristian ecclesiastical courts, which dealt with cases\r\ninvolving marriage, inheritance, and other issues) had\r\n(5) appeared in most of Western Europe, and a body of\r\nprofessional standards had been defined for them. One\r\nmight expect that the professional associations would\r\nplay a prominent role in enforcing these standards of\r\nconduct, as other guilds often did, and as modern\r\n(10) professional associations do, but that seems not to have\r\nhappened. Advocates’ professional organizations\r\nshowed little fervor for disciplining their erring\r\nmembers. Some even attempted to hobble efforts at\r\nenforcement. The Florentine guild of lawyers, for\r\n(15) example, forbade its members to play any role in\r\ndisciplinary proceedings against other guild members.\r\nIn the few recorded episodes of disciplinary\r\nenforcement, the initiative for disciplinary action\r\napparently came from a dissatisfied client, not from\r\n(20) fellow lawyers.\r\nAt first glance, there seem to be two possible\r\nexplanations for the rarity of disciplinary proceedings.\r\nMedieval canon lawyers may have generally observed\r\nthe standards of professional conduct scrupulously.\r\n(25) Alternatively, it is possible that deviations from the\r\nestablished standards of behavior were not uncommon,\r\nbut that canonical disciplinary mechanisms were so\r\ninefficient that most delinquents escaped detection and\r\npunishment.\r\n(30) Two considerations make it clear that the second of\r\nthese explanations is more plausible. First, the English\r\ncivil law courts, whose ethical standards were similar\r\nto those of ecclesiastical courts, show many more\r\nexamples of disciplinary actions against legal\r\n(35) practitioners than do the records of church courts. This\r\ndiscrepancy could well indicate that the disciplinary\r\nmechanisms of the civil courts functioned more\r\nefficiently than those of the church courts. The\r\nalternative inference, namely, that ecclesiastical\r\n(40) advocates were less prone to ethical lapses than their\r\ncounterparts in the civil courts, seems inherently weak,\r\nespecially since there was some overlap of personnel\r\nbetween the civil bar and the ecclesiastical bar.\r\nSecond, church authorities themselves complained\r\n(45) about the failure of advocates to measure up to ethical\r\nstandards and deplored the shortcomings of the\r\ndisciplinary system. Thus the Council of Basel\r\ndeclared that canon lawyers failed to adhere to the\r\nethical prescriptions laid down in numerous papal\r\n(50) constitutions and directed Cardinal Cesarini to address\r\nthe problem. In England, where medieval church\r\nrecords are extraordinarily rich, similar complaints\r\nabout the failure of the disciplinary system to reform\r\nunethical practices were very common.\r\n(55) Such criticisms seem to have had a paradoxical\r\nresult, for they apparently reinforced the professional\r\nsolidarity of lawyers at the expense of the enforcement\r\nof ethical standards. Thus the profession’s critics may\r\nactually have induced advocates to organize\r\n(60) professional associations for self-defense. The critics’\r\nattacks may also have persuaded lawyers to assign a\r\nhigher priority to defending themselves against attacks\r\nby nonprofessionals than to disciplining wayward\r\nmembers within their own ranks.\r\n7. Which one of the following best states the main\r\nconclusion of the passage?\r\n(A) Professional organizations of medieval canon\r\nlawyers probably only enforced ethical standards\r\namong their own members when provoked to do\r\nso by outside criticisms.\r\n(B) Professional organizations of medieval civil\r\nlawyers seem to have maintained stricter ethical\r\nstandards for their own members than did\r\nprofessional organizations of medieval canon\r\nlawyers.\r\n(C) Professional organizations of medieval canon\r\nlawyers apparently served to defend their\r\nmembers against critics’ attacks rather than to\r\nenforce ethical standards.\r\n(D) The ethical standards maintained by professional\r\nassociations of medieval canon lawyers were\r\nchiefly laid down in papal constitutions.\r\n(E) Ethical standards for medieval canon lawyers\r\nwere not laid down until professional\r\norganizations for these lawyers had been\r\nformed.\r\n8. According to the passage, which one of the following\r\nstatements about law courts in medieval England is true?\r\n(A) Some English lawyers who practiced in civil\r\ncourts also practiced in church courts, but others\r\nserved exclusively in one court or the other.\r\n(B) English canon lawyers were more likely to\r\ninitiate disciplinary proceedings against their\r\ncolleagues than were English civil lawyers.\r\n(C) English civil lawyers maintained more stringent\r\nethical standards than did civil lawyers in the\r\nrest of Europe.\r\n(D) English ecclesiastical courts had originally been\r\nmodeled upon English civil courts.\r\n(E) English ecclesiastical courts kept richer and more\r\nthorough records than did English civil courts.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n9. The author refers to the Florentine guild of lawyers in\r\nthe first paragraph most probably in order to\r\n(A) introduce a theory about to be promoted\r\n(B) illustrate the type of action referred to in the\r\nprevious sentence\r\n(C) underline the universality of a method\r\ndiscussed throughout the paragraph\r\n(D) point out a flaw in an argument presented\r\nearlier in the paragraph\r\n(E) rebut an anticipated objection to a thesis just\r\nproposed\r\n10.

According to the information in the passage, for\r\nwhich one of the following ethical violations would\r\ndocumentation of disciplinary action against a canon\r\nlawyer be most likely to exist?\r\n(A) betraying a client’s secrets to the opposing party\r\n(B) bribing the judge to rule in favor of a client\r\n(C) misrepresenting credentials in order to gain\r\nadmission to the lawyers’ guild\r\n(D) spreading rumors in order to discredit an\r\nopposing lawyer\r\n(E) knowingly helping a client to misrepresent the\r\ntruth\r\n12. Which one of the following is most analogous\r\nto the “professional solidarity” referred to in\r\nlines 56–57?\r\n(A) Members of a teachers’ union go on strike when\r\nthey believe one of their colleagues to be falsely\r\naccused of using an inappropriate textbook.\r\n(B) In order to protect the reputation of the press in\r\nthe face of a largely hostile public, a journalist\r\nconceals distortions in a colleague’s news\r\narticle.\r\n(C) Several dozen recording artists agree to\r\nparticipate in a concert to benefit an endangered\r\nenvironmental habitat.\r\n(D) In order to expedite governmental approval of a\r\ndrug, a government official is persuaded to look\r\nthe other way when a pharmaceutical\r\nmanufacturer conceals evidence that the drug\r\nmay have minor side effects.\r\n(E) A popular politician agrees to campaign for\r\nanother, less popular politician belonging to the\r\nsame political party.\r\n13. The passage suggests that which one of the following\r\nis most likely to have been true of medieval guilds?\r\n(A) Few guilds of any importance existed before the\r\nmid-fourteenth century.\r\n(B) Many medieval guilds exercised influence over\r\nthe actions of their members.\r\n(C) Most medieval guilds maintained more exacting\r\nethical standards than did the associations of\r\ncanon lawyers.\r\n(D) Medieval guilds found it difficult to enforce\r\ndiscipline among their members.\r\n(E) The ethical standards of medieval guilds varied\r\nfrom one city to another.\r\n14. The author would be most likely to agree with which\r\none of the following regarding the hypothesis that\r\nmedieval canon lawyers observed standards of\r\nprofessional conduct scrupulously?\r\n(A) It is untrue because it is contradicted by\r\ndocuments obtained from the ecclesiastical\r\ncourts.\r\n(B) It is unlikely because it describes behavior\r\nmarkedly different from behavior observed in\r\nthe same situation in modern society.\r\n(C) It is unlikely because it describes behavior\r\nmarkedly different from behavior observed in\r\na similar area of medieval society.\r\n(D) It is impossible to assess intelligently because of\r\nthe dearth of civil and ecclesiastical documents.\r\n(E) It is directly supported by documents obtained\r\nfrom civil and ecclesiastical courts.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n99\r\n100\r\nMany birds that form flocks compete through\r\naggressive interaction for priority of access to\r\nresources such as food and shelter. The result of\r\nrepeated interactions between flock members is that\r\n(5) each bird gains a particular social status related to its\r\nfighting ability, with priority of access to resources\r\nincreasing with higher status. As the number and\r\nintensity of interactions between birds increase,\r\nhowever, so increase the costs to each bird in terms of\r\n(10) energy expenditure, time, and risk of injury. Thus,\r\nbirds possessing attributes that reduce the number of\r\ncostly interactions in which they must be involved,\r\nwithout leading to a reduction in status, are at an\r\nadvantage. An external signal, such as a plumage type,\r\n(15) announcing fighting ability and thereby obviating the\r\nactual need to fight, could be one such attribute.\r\nThe zoologist Rohwer asserted that plumage\r\nvariations in “Harris sparrows” support the status\r\nsignaling hypothesis (SSH). He reported that almost\r\n(20) without exception birds with darker throats win\r\nconflicts with individuals having lighter plumage. He\r\nclaimed that even among birds of the same age and sex\r\nthe amount of dark plumage predicts relative\r\ndominance status.\r\n(25) However, Rohwer’s data do not support his\r\nassertions: in one of his studies darker birds won only\r\n57 out of 75 conflicts; within another, focusing on\r\nconflicts between birds of the same age group or sex,\r\ndarker birds won 63 and lost 62. There are indications\r\n(30) that plumage probably does signal broad age-related\r\ndifferences in status among Harris sparrows: adults,\r\nusually dark throated, have higher status than juveniles,\r\nwho are usually light throated; moreover, juveniles\r\ndyed to resemble adults are dominant over undyed\r\n(35) juveniles. However, the Harris sparrows’ age-related\r\nplumage differences do not signal the status of\r\nindividual birds within an age class, and thus cannot\r\nproperly be included under the term “status signaling.”\r\nThe best evidence for status signaling is from the\r\n(40) greater titmouse. Experiments show a strong\r\ncorrelation between the width of the black breast-\r\nplumage stripe and status as measured by success in\r\naggressive interactions. An analysis of factors likely to\r\nbe associated with breast-stripe width (sex, age, wing\r\n(45) length, body weight) has demonstrated social status to\r\nbe the only variable that correlates with stripe width\r\nwhen the other variables are held constant.\r\nAn ingenious experiment provided further evidence\r\nfor status signaling in the greater titmouse. One of\r\n(50) three stuffed titmouse dummies was mounted on a\r\nfeeding tray. When a live bird approached, the dummy\r\nwas turned by radio control to face the bird and present\r\nits breast stripe in “display.” When presented with a\r\ndummy having a narrower breast stripe than their own,\r\n(55) birds approached closely and behaved aggressively.\r\nHowever, when presented with a dummy having a\r\nbroader breast stripe than their own, live birds acted\r\nsubmissive and did not approach.\r\n15. According to the passage, the status signaling\r\nhypothesis holds that the ability to display a\r\nrecognizable external signal would have the effect on\r\nan individual bird of\r\n(A) enabling it to attract a mate of high status\r\n(B) allowing it to avoid costly aggressive interactions\r\n(C) decreasing its access to limited resources\r\n(D) making it less attractive to predatory species\r\n(E) increasing its fighting ability\r\n16.

Lowe bases his study on a\r\ndetailed examination of the known archaeological\r\n(5) record. Like previous investigators, Lowe relies on\r\ndated monuments to construct a step-by-step account\r\nof the actual collapse. Using the erection of new\r\nmonuments as a means to determine a site’s occupation\r\nspan, Lowe assumes that once new monuments ceased\r\n(10) to be built, a site had been abandoned. Lowe’s analysis\r\nof the evidence suggests that construction of new\r\nmonuments continued to increase between A.D. 672\r\nand 751, but that the civilization stopped expanding\r\ngeographically; new construction took place almost\r\n(15) exclusively in established settlements. The first signs\r\nof trouble followed. Monument inscriptions indicate\r\nthat between 751 and 790, long-standing alliances\r\nstarted to break down. Evidence also indicates that\r\nbetween 790 and 830, the death rate in Classic Mayan\r\n(20) cities outstripped the birthrate. After approximately\r\n830, construction stopped throughout the area, and\r\nwithin a hundred years, the Classic Mayan civilization\r\nall but vanished.\r\nHaving established this chronology, Lowe sets\r\n(25) forth a plausible explanation of the collapse that\r\naccommodates the available archaeological evidence.\r\nHe theorizes that Classic Mayan civilization was\r\nbrought down by the interaction of several factors, set\r\nin motion by population growth. An increase in\r\n(30) population, particularly within the elite segment of\r\nsociety, necessitated ever more intense farming.\r\nAgricultural intensification exerted stress on the soil\r\nand led to a decline in productivity (the amount of food\r\nproduced through each unit of labor invested). At the\r\n(35) same time, the growth of the elite class created\r\nincreasing demands for ceremonial monuments and\r\nluxuries, diverting needed labor from the fields. The\r\ntheory holds that these stresses were communicated—\r\nand amplified—throughout the area as Mayan states\r\n(40) engaged in warfare to acquire laborers and food, and\r\nrefugees fled impoverished areas. The most vulnerable\r\nstates thus began to break down, and each downfall\r\ntriggered others, until the entire civilization collapsed.\r\nIf there is a central flaw in Lowe’s explanation, it is\r\n(45) that the entire edifice rests on the assumption that the\r\navailable evidence paints a true picture of how the\r\ncollapse proceeded. However, it is difficult to know\r\nhow accurately the archaeological record reflects\r\nhistoric activity, especially of a complex civilization\r\n(50) such as the Mayans’, and a hypothesis can be tested\r\nonly against the best available data. It is quite possible\r\nthat our understanding of the collapse might be\r\nradically altered by better data. For example, Lowe’s\r\nassumption about monument construction and the\r\n(55) occupation span of a site might well be disproved if\r\nfurther investigations of Classic Mayan sites\r\nestablished that some remained heavily settled long\r\nafter the custom of carving dynastic monuments had\r\nceased.\r\n22. Which one of the following best describes the\r\norganization of the passage?\r\n(A) A method used to analyze evidence is described,\r\nan explanation of the evidence is suggested, and\r\nthen a conclusion is drawn from the evidence.\r\n(B) A hypothesis is presented, evidence supporting\r\nthe hypothesis is provided, and then the\r\nhypothesis is affirmed.\r\n(C) An analysis of a study is presented, contradictory\r\nevidence is examined, and then a direction for\r\nfuture studies is suggested.\r\n(D) The basis of a study is described, a theory that\r\nexplains the available evidence is presented, and\r\na possible flaw in the study is pointed out.\r\n(E) An observation is made, evidence supporting the\r\nobservation is presented, and then contradictions\r\nin the evidence are discussed.\r\n23. Which one of the following best expresses the main idea\r\nof the passage?\r\n(A) In The Dynamics of Apocalypse, John Lowe\r\nsuccessfully proves that the collapse of Classic\r\nMayan civilization was set in motion by\r\nincreasing population and decreasing\r\nproductivity.\r\n(B) In The Dynamics of Apocalypse, John Lowe breaks\r\nnew ground in solving the mystery of the\r\ncollapse of Classic Mayan civilization through\r\nhis use of dated monuments to create a step-by-\r\nstep account of the collapse.\r\n(C) In The Dynamics of Apocalypse, John Lowe\r\nsuccessfully uses existing data to document the\r\nreduction and then cessation of new construction\r\nthroughout Classic Mayan civilization.\r\n(D) Although John Lowe’s study is based on a careful\r\nexamination of the historical record, it does not\r\naccurately reflect the circumstances surrounding\r\nthe collapse of Classic Mayan civilization.\r\n(E) While John Lowe’s theory about the collapse of\r\nClassic Mayan civilization appears credible, it is\r\nbased on an assumption that cannot be verified\r\nusing the archaeological record.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n24. Which one of the following is most closely analogous to\r\nthe assumption Lowe makes about the relationship\r\nbetween monument construction and Classic Mayan\r\ncities?\r\n(A) A person assumes that the shortage of fresh\r\nproduce on the shelves of a grocery store is due\r\nto the effects of poor weather conditions\r\nduring the growing season.\r\n(B) A person assumes that a movie theater only\r\nshows foreign films because the titles of the\r\nfilms shown there are not familiar to the\r\nperson.\r\n(C) A person assumes that a restaurant is under new\r\nownership because the restaurant’s menu has\r\nchanged drastically since the last time the person\r\nate there.\r\n(D) A person assumes that a corporation has been\r\nsold because there is a new name for the\r\ncorporation on the sign outside the building\r\nwhere the company is located.\r\n(E) A person assumes a friend has sold her stamp\r\ncollection because the friend has stopped\r\npurchasing new stamps.\r\n25. It can be inferred from the passage that the author would\r\ndescribe the method Lowe used to construct a step-by-\r\nstep chronology of the actual collapse of Classic\r\nMayan civilization as\r\n(A) daringly innovative but flawed\r\n(B) generally accepted but questionable\r\n(C) very reliable but outdated\r\n(D) unscientific but effective\r\n(E) unconventional but brilliant\r\n26. The author of the passage would most likely\r\nagree with which one of the following\r\nstatements about the use of the archaeological record\r\nto reconstruct historic activity?\r\n(A) With careful analysis, archaeological evidence\r\ncan be used to reconstruct accurately the historic\r\nactivity of a past civilization.\r\n(B) Archaeological evidence is more useful for\r\nreconstructing the day-to-day activities of a\r\nculture than its long-term trends.\r\n(C) The accuracy of the archaeological record for\r\nreconstructing historic activity is dependent on\r\nthe duration of the particular civilization.\r\n(D) The archaeological record is not an appropriate\r\nsource of data for reconstructing historic\r\nactivity.\r\n(E) Historic activity can be reconstructed from\r\narchaeological evidence, but it is ultimately\r\nimpossible to confirm the accuracy of the\r\nreconstruction.\r\n103\r\nSTOP\r\nIF YOU FINISH BEFORE TIME IS CALLED, YOU MAY CHECK YOUR WORK ON THIS SECTION ONLY.\r\nDO NOT WORK ON ANY OTHER SECTION IN THE TEST.\r\n104\r\nSECTION III\r\nTime—35 minutes\r\n24 Questions\r\nDirections: Each group of questions in this section is based on a set of conditions.

After you have chosen the best an-\r\nswer, blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.\r\n1. Critic: People today place an especially high\r\nvalue on respect for others; yet, in their comedy\r\nacts, many of today’s most popular comedians\r\ndisplay blatant disrespect for others. But when\r\npeople fail to live up to the very ideals they hold\r\nin highest esteem, exaggeration of such failings\r\noften forms the basis of successful comedy. Thus\r\nthe current popularity of comedians who display\r\ndisrespect in their acts is hardly surprising.\r\nThe critic’s argument depends on which one of the\r\nfollowing assumptions?\r\n(A) People who enjoy comedians who display\r\ndisrespect in their acts do not place a high value\r\non respect for others.\r\n(B) Only comedians who display blatant disrespect in\r\ntheir acts are currently successful.\r\n(C) Many people disapprove of the portrayal of\r\nblatant disrespect for others in comedy acts.\r\n(D) People who value an ideal especially highly do\r\nnot always succeed in living up to this ideal.\r\n(E) People today fail to live up to their own ideals\r\nmore frequently than was the case in the past.\r\n2. The law firm of Sutherlin, Pérez, and Associates is one\r\nof the most successful law firms whose primary\r\nspecialization is in criminal defense cases. In fact, the\r\nfirm has a better than 90 percent acquittal rate in such\r\ncases. Dalton is an attorney whose primary specialization\r\nis in divorce cases, so Dalton certainly cannot be a\r\nmember of Sutherlin, Pérez, and Associates.\r\nThe reasoning in the argument is flawed because\r\nthe argument\r\n(A) offers in support of its conclusion pieces of\r\nevidence that are mutually contradictory\r\n(B) overlooks the possibility that a person can\r\npractice law without being a member of a law\r\nfirm\r\n(C) concludes that someone is not a member of a\r\ngroup on the grounds that that person does not\r\nhave a characteristic that the group as a whole\r\nhas\r\n(D) takes a high rate of success among the members\r\nof a group to indicate that the successes are\r\nevenly spread among the members\r\n(E) states a generalization based on a selection that is\r\nnot representative of the group about which the\r\ngeneralization is supposed to hold true\r\n3. Opponents of allowing triple-trailer trucks to use the\r\nnational highway system are wrong in claiming that\r\nthese trucks are more dangerous than other commercial\r\nvehicles. In the western part of the country, in areas\r\nwhere triple-trailers are now permitted on some\r\nhighways, for these vehicles the rate of road accident\r\nfatalities per mile of travel is lower than the national\r\nrate for other types of commercial vehicles. Clearly, triple-\r\ntrailers are safer than other commercial vehicles.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most substantially\r\nweakens the argument?\r\n(A) It takes two smaller semitrailers to haul as much\r\nweight as a single triple-trailer can.\r\n(B) Highways in the sparsely populated West are\r\nmuch less heavily traveled and consequently are\r\nfar safer than highways in the national system as\r\na whole.\r\n(C) Opponents of the triple-trailers also once opposed\r\nthe shorter twin-trailers, which are now common\r\non the nation’s highways.\r\n(D) In areas where the triple-trailers are permitted,\r\ndrivers need a special license to operate them.\r\n(E) For triple-trailers the rate of road accident\r\nfatalities per mile of travel was higher last year\r\nthan in the two previous years.\r\n4.

A newly developed light bulb is much more cost-\r\neffective than conventional light bulbs: it costs only\r\nabout 3 times what a conventional light bulb costs but it\r\nlasts up to 10 times as long as a conventional light bulb.\r\nDespite the manufacturer’s intense efforts to publicize\r\nthe advantages of the new bulb, one analyst predicts that\r\nthese new bulbs will prove to sell very poorly.\r\nEach of the following, if true, provides support for\r\nthe analyst’s prediction EXCEPT:\r\n(A) The light generated by the new bulb is in the\r\nyellow range of the spectrum, a type of artificial\r\nlight most people find unappealing.\r\n(B) Most people who purchase light bulbs prefer to\r\nbuy inexpensive light bulbs rather than more\r\ndurable but expensive light bulbs.\r\n(C) A manufacturer of one brand of conventional\r\nlight bulb has advertised claims that the new\r\nlight bulb uses more electricity than do\r\nconventional light bulbs.\r\n(D) The new bulb is to be marketed in several\r\ndifferent quantities, ranging from packages\r\ncontaining one bulb to packages containing four\r\nbulbs.\r\n(E) A competing manufacturer is about to introduce a\r\nlight bulb that lasts 10 times as long as a\r\nconventional bulb but costs less than a\r\nconventional bulb.\r\n6. The Rienzi, a passenger ship, sank as a result of a hole\r\nin its hull, possibly caused by sabotage. Normally, when\r\na holed ship sinks as rapidly as the Rienzi did, water does\r\nnot enter the ship quickly enough for the ship to be fully\r\nflooded when it reaches the ocean floor. Full flooding\r\ncan be achieved, however, by sabotage. Any ship that\r\nsinks deep into the ocean when not fully flooded will\r\nimplode. Deep-sea photographs, taken of the sunken\r\nRienzi where it rests on the ocean floor, reveal that the\r\nRienzi did not implode.\r\nWhich one of the following must be true on the basis of\r\nthe information above?\r\n(A) The Rienzi was so constructed as to reduce the\r\nrisk of sinking by impact.\r\n(B) If the Rienzi became fully flooded, it did so only\r\nafter it reached the ocean floor.\r\n(C) If the Rienzi was not sunk by sabotage, water\r\nflooded into it unusually fast.\r\n(D) If the Rienzi had sunk more slowly, it would have\r\nimploded.\r\n(E) The Rienzi was so strongly constructed as to resist\r\nimploding under deep-sea pressure.\r\n7. For every 50 dogs that contract a certain disease, one\r\nwill die from it. A vaccine exists that is virtually\r\n100 percent effective in preventing this disease. Since\r\nthe risk of death from complications of vaccination is\r\none death per 5,000 vaccinations, it is therefore safer for\r\na dog to receive the vaccine than not to receive it.\r\nWhich one of the following would it be most helpful\r\nto know in order to evaluate the argument?\r\n(A) the total number of dogs that die each year from\r\nall causes taken together\r\n(B) whether the vaccine is effective against the\r\ndisease in household pets other than dogs\r\n(C) the number of dogs that die each year from\r\ndiseases other than the disease in question\r\n(D) the likelihood that a dog will contract another\r\ndisease such as rabies\r\n(E) the likelihood that an unvaccinated dog will\r\ncontract the disease in question\r\n8. The symptoms of mental disorders are behavioral,\r\ncognitive, or emotional problems. Some patients with\r\nmental disorders can be effectively treated with\r\npsychotherapy. But it is now known that in some patients\r\nmental disorders result from chemical imbalances\r\naffecting the brain. Thus these patients can be\r\neffectively treated only with medication that will reduce\r\nor correct the imbalance.\r\nThe argument depends on assuming which one of the\r\nfollowing?\r\n(A) Treatment by psychotherapy can produce no\r\neffective reduction in or correction of chemical\r\nimbalances that cause mental disorders.\r\n(B) Treatment with medication always shows faster\r\nresults for patients with mental disorders than\r\ndoes treatment with psychotherapy.\r\n(C) Most mental disorders are not the result of\r\nchemical imbalances affecting the brain.\r\n(D) Medication is always more effective in treating\r\npatients with mental disorders than is\r\npsychotherapy.\r\n(E) Treatment with psychotherapy has no effect on\r\nmental disorders other than a reduction of the\r\nsymptoms.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\nQuestions 9–10\r\nCurator: The decision to restore the cloak of the central\r\nfigure in Veronese’s painting from its present red to\r\nthe green found underneath is fully justified.\r\nReliable x-ray and chemical tests show that the red\r\npigment was applied after the painting had been\r\ncompleted, and that the red paint was not mixed in\r\nVeronese’s workshop. Hence it appears likely that an\r\nartist other than Veronese tampered with Veronese’s\r\npainting after its completion.\r\nArt critic: But in a copy of Veronese’s painting made shortly\r\nafter Veronese died, the cloak is red. It is highly\r\nunlikely that a copyist would have made so major\r\na change so soon after Veronese’s death.\r\n9. The assertion that a later artist tampered with Veronese’s\r\npainting serves which one of the following functions in\r\nthe curator’s argument?\r\n(A) It is the main point toward which the argument as\r\na whole is directed.\r\n(B) It is a subsidiary conclusion that supports the\r\nargument’s main conclusion.\r\n(C) It is a clarification of a key term of the argument.\r\n(D) It is a particular instance of the general position to\r\nbe defended.\r\n(E) It is a reiteration of the main point that is made\r\nfor the sake of emphasis.\r\n10. The art critic’s response to the curator would provide the\r\nstrongest support for which one of the following\r\nconclusions?\r\n(A) The copy of Veronese’s painting that was made\r\nsoon after the painter’s death is indistinguishable\r\nfrom the original.\r\n(B) No painting should be restored before the\r\npainting is tested with technologically\r\nsophisticated equipment.\r\n(C) The proposed restoration will fail to restore\r\nVeronese’s painting to the appearance it had at\r\nthe end of the artist’s lifetime.\r\n(D) The value of an artist’s work is not necessarily\r\ncompromised when that work is tampered with\r\nby later artists.\r\n(E) Veronese did not originally intend the central\r\nfigure’s cloak to be green.\r\n11. John works five days each week except when on\r\nvacation or during weeks in which national holidays\r\noccur. Four days a week he works in an insurance\r\ncompany; on Fridays he works as a blacksmith. Last\r\nweek there were no holidays, and John was not on\r\nvacation. Therefore, he must have worked in the\r\ninsurance company on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\r\nand Thursday last week.\r\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which\r\nthe argument depends?\r\n(A) John never takes a vacation of more than one\r\nweek in length.\r\n(B) Every day last week that John worked, he worked\r\nfor an entire workday.\r\n(C) John does not take vacations in weeks in which\r\nnational holidays occur.\r\n(D) Last week John worked neither on Saturday nor\r\non Sunday.\r\n(E) There were no days last week on which John both\r\nworked in the insurance company and also\r\nworked as a blacksmith.\r\n12. After several attempts to distract his young parrot\r\nfrom chewing on furniture, George reluctantly took an\r\nexpert’s advice and gently hit the parrot’s beak whenever\r\nthe bird started to chew furniture. The bird stopped\r\nchewing furniture, but it is now afraid of hands and will\r\nsometimes bite. Since chewing on the furniture would\r\nnot have hurt the bird, George should not have hit it.\r\nWhen Carla’s puppy escaped from her yard, it bounded\r\ninto a busy street. Although Carla does not generally\r\napprove of physical discipline, she hit the puppy sharply\r\nwith her hand. Now the puppy enters the street only\r\nwhen accompanied by Carla, so Carla was justified in\r\ndisciplining the puppy.\r\nWhich one of the following principles, if established,\r\nwould justify the judgments about George’s and Carla’s\r\nactions?\r\n(A) When disciplining an animal physically, a trainer\r\nshould use an object such as a rolled up\r\nnewspaper to avoid making the animal\r\nfrightened of hands.\r\n(B) When training an animal, physical discipline\r\nshould be used only when such discipline is\r\nnecessary to correct behavior that could result in\r\nserious harm to the animal.\r\n(C) Using physical discipline to train an animal is\r\njustified only when all alternative strategies for\r\ncorrecting undesirable behavior have failed.\r\n(D) Physical discipline should not be used on\r\nimmature animals.\r\n(E) Physical discipline should not be used by an\r\nanimal trainer except to correct persistent\r\nbehavior problems.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n110\r\n111\r\n13. Mature white pines intercept almost all the sunlight\r\nthat shines on them. They leave a deep litter that\r\ndries readily, and they grow to prodigious height so\r\nthat, even when there are large gaps in a stand of\r\nsuch trees, little light reaches the forest floor. For this\r\nreason white pines cannot regenerate in their own\r\nshade. Thus, when in a dense forest a stand of trees\r\nconsists of nothing but mature white pines, it is a fair\r\nbet that ____.\r\nWhich one of the following most logically concludes\r\nthe argument?\r\n(A) the ages of the trees in the stand do not differ\r\nfrom each other by much more than the length\r\nof time it takes a white pine to grow to\r\nmaturity\r\n(B) the land on which the stand is now growing had\r\nbeen cleared of all trees at the time when the\r\nfirst of the white pines started growing\r\n(C) competition among the trees in the stand for\r\nsunlight will soon result in some trees’ dying\r\nand the stand thus becoming thinner\r\n(D) other species of trees will soon begin to colonize\r\nthe stand, eventually replacing all of the white\r\npines\r\n(E) any differences in the heights of the trees in the\r\nstand are attributable solely to differences in\r\nthe ages of the trees\r\n14. Advertisement: A leading economist has determined\r\nthat among people who used computers at their\r\nplace of employment last year, those who also\r\nowned portable (”laptop”) computers earned\r\n25 percent more on average than those who did\r\nnot. It is obvious from this that owning a laptop\r\ncomputer led to a higher-paying job.\r\nWhich one of the following identifies a reasoning\r\nerror in the argument?\r\n(A) It attempts to support a sweeping generalization\r\non the basis of information about only a small\r\nnumber of individuals.\r\n(B) Its conclusion merely restates a claim made\r\nearlier in the argument.\r\n(C) It concludes that one thing was caused by another\r\nalthough the evidence given is consistent with\r\nthe first thing’s having caused the second.\r\n(D) It offers information as support for a conclusion\r\nwhen that information actually shows that the\r\nconclusion is false.\r\n(E) It uncritically projects currently existing trends\r\nindefinitely into the future.\r\n15. Rhonda will see the movie tomorrow afternoon only if\r\nPaul goes to the concert in the afternoon. Paul will not\r\ngo to the concert unless Ted agrees to go to the concert.\r\nHowever, Ted refuses to go to the concert. So Rhonda\r\nwill not see the movie tomorrow afternoon.\r\nThe pattern of reasoning displayed above is most closely\r\nparalleled in which one of the following?\r\n(A) If Janice comes to visit, Mary will not pay the\r\nbills tomorrow. Janice will not come to visit\r\nunless she locates a babysitter. However, Janice\r\nhas located a babysitter, so she will visit Mary.\r\n(B) Gary will do his laundry tomorrow only if Peter\r\nhas to go to work. Unless Cathy is ill, Peter will\r\nnot have to go to work. Since Cathy is not ill,\r\nGary will not do his laundry tomorrow.\r\n(C) Kelly will barbecue fish tonight if it does not rain\r\nand the market has fresh trout. Although the\r\nforecast does not call for rain, the market does\r\nnot have fresh trout. So Kelly will not barbecue\r\nfish tonight.\r\n(D) Lisa will attend the family reunion next week\r\nonly if one of her brothers, Jared or Karl, also\r\nattends. Karl will not attend the reunion, but\r\nJared will. So Lisa will attend the reunion.\r\n(E) George will not go to the museum tomorrow\r\nunless Mark agrees to go. Mark will go to the\r\nmuseum only if he can postpone most of his\r\nappointments. Mark has postponed some of his\r\nappointments, so he will go to the museum.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n16. Private industry is trying to attract skilled research\r\nscientists by offering them high salaries. As a result,\r\nmost research scientists employed in private industry\r\nnow earn 50 percent more than do comparably skilled\r\nresearch scientists employed by the government. So,\r\nunless government-employed research scientists are\r\nmotivated more by a sense of public duty than by their\r\nown interests, the government is likely to lose its most\r\nskilled research scientists to private industry, since none\r\nof these scientists would have problems finding private-\r\nsector jobs.\r\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which\r\nthe argument depends?\r\n(A) Government research scientists are less likely to\r\nreceive acknowledgment for their research\r\ncontributions than are research scientists in the\r\nprivate sector.\r\n(B) None of the research scientists currently\r\nemployed by the government earns more than\r\nthe highest-paid researchers employed in the\r\nprivate sector.\r\n(C) The government does not employ as many\r\nresearch scientists who are highly skilled as does\r\nany large company in the private sector which\r\nemploys research scientists.\r\n(D) The government does not provide its research\r\nscientists with unusually good working\r\nconditions or fringe benefits that more than\r\ncompensate for the lower salaries they receive.\r\n(E) Research scientists employed in the private sector\r\ngenerally work longer hours than do researchers\r\nemployed by the government.\r\n17. Using fossil energy more efficiently is in the interest\r\nof the nation and the global environment, but major\r\nimprovements are unlikely unless proposed\r\ngovernment standards are implemented to eliminate\r\nproducts or practices that are among the least\r\nefficient in their class.\r\nObjection: Decisions on energy use are best left to the\r\noperation of the market.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most directly\r\nundermines the objection above?\r\n(A) It would be unrealistic to expect society to make\r\nthe changes necessary to achieve maximum\r\nenergy efficiency all at once.\r\n(B) There are products, such as automobiles, that\r\nconsume energy at a sufficient rate that persons\r\nwho purchase and use them will become\r\nconscious of any unusual energy inefficiency in\r\ncomparison with other products in the same\r\nclass.\r\n(C) Whenever a new mode of generating energy, such\r\nas a new fuel, is introduced, a number of support\r\nsystems, such as a fuel-distribution system, must\r\nbe created or adapted.\r\n(D) When energy prices rise, consumers of energy\r\ntend to look for new ways to increase energy\r\nefficiency, such as by adding insulation to their\r\nhouses.\r\n(E) Often the purchaser of a product, such as a\r\nlandlord buying an appliance, chooses on the\r\nbasis of purchase price because the purchaser is\r\nnot the person who will pay for energy used by\r\nthe product.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n112\r\n113\r\n18. Dobson: Some historians claim that the people\r\nwho built a ring of stones thousands of years ago\r\nin Britain were knowledgeable about celestial\r\nevents. The ground for this claim is that two of the\r\nstones determine a line pointing directly to the\r\nposition of the sun at sunrise at the spring\r\nequinox. There are many stones in the ring,\r\nhowever, so the chance that one pair will point in\r\na celestially significant direction is large.\r\nTherefore, the people who built the ring were not\r\nknowledgeable about celestial events.\r\nWhich one of the following is an error of reasoning\r\nin Dobson’s argument?\r\n(A) The failure of cited evidence to establish a\r\nstatement is taken as evidence that that\r\nstatement is false.\r\n(B) Dobson’s conclusion logically contradicts some\r\nof the evidence presented in support of it.\r\n(C) Statements that absolutely establish Dobson’s\r\nconclusion are treated as if they merely give\r\nsome support to that conclusion.\r\n(D) Something that is merely a matter of opinion is\r\ntreated as if it were subject to verification as a\r\nmatter of fact.\r\n(E) Dobson’s drawing the conclusion relies on\r\ninterpreting a key term in two different ways.\r\n19. Nearly all mail that is correctly addressed arrives at its\r\ndestination within two business days of being sent. In\r\nfact, correctly addressed mail takes longer than this only\r\nwhen it is damaged in transit. Overall, however, most\r\nmail arrives three business days or more after being sent.\r\nIf the statements above are true, which one of the\r\nfollowing must be true?\r\n(A) A large proportion of the mail that is correctly\r\naddressed is damaged in transit.\r\n(B) No incorrectly addressed mail arrives within two\r\nbusiness days of being sent.\r\n(C) Most mail that arrives within two business days\r\nof being sent is correctly addressed.\r\n(D) A large proportion of mail is incorrectly\r\naddressed.\r\n(E) More mail arrives within two business days of\r\nbeing sent than arrives between two and three\r\nbusiness days after being sent.\r\n20. The report released by the interior ministry states\r\nthat within the past 5 years the national land-\r\nreclamation program has resulted in a 19 percent\r\nincrease in the amount of arable land within the\r\ncountry. If these figures are accurate, the program has\r\nbeen a resounding success. Senator Armand, a\r\ndistinguished mathematician and a woman of\r\nindisputable brilliance, maintains, however, that the\r\nreclamation program could not possibly have been\r\nsuccessful. Clearly, therefore, the figures cited in the\r\nreport cannot be accurate.\r\nThe argument above exhibits an erroneous pattern\r\nof reasoning most similar to that exhibited by which\r\none of the following?\r\n(A) Albert’s father claims that Albert does not know\r\nwhere the spare car keys are hidden.\r\nYesterday, however, Albert reported that he\r\nhad discovered the spare car keys in the\r\ngarage toolbox, so his father’s claim cannot be\r\ntrue.\r\n(B) Gloria’s drama teacher claims that her policy is\r\nto give each student the opportunity to act in\r\nat least one play during the year but, since\r\nGloria, who attended every class, reports that\r\nshe was not given such an opportunity, the\r\nteacher’s claim cannot be true.\r\n(C) Amos claims that he can hold his breath under\r\nwater for a full hour. Dr. Treviso, a\r\ncardiopulmonary specialist, has stated that\r\nhumans are physiologically incapable of\r\nholding their breath for even half that long; so\r\nAmos’ claim cannot be true.\r\n(D) Evelyn reports that she got home before\r\nmidnight. Robert, who always knows the time,\r\ninsists that she did not. If Robert is right,\r\nEvelyn could not possibly have listened to the\r\nlate news; since she admits not having listened\r\nto the late news, her report cannot be true.\r\n(E) Moira, after observing the finish of the\r\n60-kilometer bicycle race, reports that Lee won\r\nwith Adams a distant third. Lomas, a bicycle\r\nengineering expert, insists, however, that Lee\r\ncould not have won a race in which Adams\r\ncompeted; so Moira’s report cannot be true.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n114\r\nQuestions 21–22\r\nWirth: All efforts to identify a gene responsible for\r\npredisposing people to manic-depression have\r\nfailed. In fact, nearly all researchers now agree\r\nthat there is no “manic-depression gene.”\r\nTherefore, if these researchers are right, any claim\r\nthat some people are genetically predisposed to\r\nmanic-depression is simply false.\r\nChang: I do not dispute your evidence, but I take\r\nissue with your conclusion. Many of the\r\nresearchers you refer to have found evidence that\r\na set of several genes is involved and that\r\ncomplex interactions among these genes produce\r\na predisposition to manic-depression.\r\n21. The point at issue between Wirth and Chang is whether\r\n(A) efforts to identify a gene or set of several genes\r\nresponsible for predisposing people to\r\nmanic-depression have all failed\r\n(B) it is likely that researchers will ever be able to\r\nfind a single gene that predisposes people to\r\nmanic-depression\r\n(C) nearly all researchers now agree that there is no\r\nmanic-depression gene\r\n(D) current research supports the claim that no one\r\nis genetically predisposed to manic-depression\r\n(E) the efforts made to find a gene that can produce\r\na predisposition to manic-depression were\r\nthorough\r\n22. Which one of the following most accurately expresses\r\nChang’s criticism of Wirth’s argument?\r\n(A) It presupposes only one possibility where more\r\nthan one exists.\r\n(B) It depends on separate pieces of evidence that\r\ncontradict each other.\r\n(C) It relies on the opinion of experts in an area\r\noutside the experts’ field of expertise.\r\n(D) It disallows in principle any evidence that\r\nwould disconfirm its conclusion.\r\n(E) It treats something that is merely unlikely as\r\nthough it were impossible.\r\n23. Garbage dumps do not harm wildlife. Evidence is\r\nfurnished by the Masai-Mara reserve in Kenya,\r\nwhere baboons that use the garbage dumps on the\r\nreserve as a food source mature faster and have more\r\noffspring than do baboons on the reserve that do not\r\nscavenge on garbage.\r\nEach of the following statements, if true, casts doubt\r\non the argument EXCEPT:\r\n(A) The baboons that feed on the garbage dump are\r\nof a different species from those that do not.\r\n(B) The life expectancy of baboons that eat garbage\r\nis significantly lower than that of baboons that\r\ndo not eat garbage.\r\n(C) The cholesterol level of garbage-eating baboons\r\nis dangerously higher than that of baboons\r\nthat do not eat garbage.\r\n(D) The population of hyenas that live near\r\nunregulated garbage landfills north of the\r\nreserve has doubled in the last two years.\r\n(E) The rate of birth defects for the baboon\r\npopulation on the reserve has doubled since\r\nthe first landfills were opened.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n115\r\nQuestions 24–25\r\nMarianne is a professional chess player who hums audibly\r\nwhile playing her matches, thereby distracting her opponents.\r\nWhen ordered by chess officials to cease humming or else\r\nbe disqualified from professional chess, Marianne protested\r\nthe order. She argued that since she was unaware of her\r\nhumming, her humming was involuntary and that\r\ntherefore she should not be held responsible for it.\r\n24. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most\r\nhelps to support Marianne’s argument against the\r\norder?\r\n(A) Chess players who hum audibly while playing\r\ntheir matches should not protest if their\r\nopponents also hum.\r\n(B) Of a player’s actions, only those that are\r\nvoluntary should be used as justification for\r\ndisqualifying that player from professional\r\nchess.\r\n(C) A person should be held responsible for those\r\ninvoluntary actions that serve that person’s\r\ninterests.\r\n(D) Types of behavior that are not considered\r\nvoluntary in everyday circumstances should\r\nbe considered voluntary if they occur in the\r\ncontext of a professional chess match.\r\n(E) Chess players should be disqualified from\r\nprofessional chess matches if they regularly\r\nattempt to distract their opponents.\r\n25. Which one of the following, if true, most undermines\r\nMarianne’s argument against the order?\r\n(A) The officials of chess have little or no authority\r\nto control the behavior of its professional\r\nplayers outside of matches.\r\n(B) Many of the customs of amateur chess matches\r\nare not observed by professional chess players.\r\n(C) Not all of a person’s involuntary actions are\r\nactions of which that person is unaware.\r\n(D) A person who hums involuntarily can easily\r\nlearn to notice it and can thereby come to\r\ncontrol it.\r\n(E) Not all of Marianne’s opponents are distracted\r\nby her humming during chess matches.\r\n26. Smoking in bed has long been the main cause of\r\nhome fires.

B\r\nThe Sample Test\r\n119\r\nLSAT Writing Sample Topic\r\nRoberto Martinez, owner of a small used bookstore, has recently purchased an adjacent store and is deciding how best to use it to expand his business. Write an\r\nargument in support of one plan over the other based on the following criteria:\r\nc108 Martinez wants to attract a significant number of new customers.\r\nc108 Martinez wants to retain the loyal clientele who look to him for out-of-print books and first editions.\r\nOne plan is for Martinez to begin carrying best-sellers and popular fiction. Because of his downtown location, publishers of these works are likely to put his store on\r\ntheir book tours; although the large bookstore chains have taken hold in the suburbs, none has yet located in the downtown area. Under this plan, however, Martinez would\r\nhave enough room to keep only the best books from his current inventory. To capitalize on this collection, he is considering an occasional evening series called “Rediscoveries,”\r\nfeaturing discussions of authors whose out-of-print books he carries, particularly several authors who are currently enjoying a resurgence of critical attention.\r\nAn alternative plan is for Martinez to use the new space to open a small coffeehouse with a limited menu. He would furnish the area as a sitting room with couches\r\nand chairs and a few regular dining tables. Although there are several restaurants nearby, they offer primarily full meals in more formal settings. Retaining much of his\r\ninventory of used books, he would add novels, poetry, and nonfiction published by small presses to feature lesser-known writers whose work is difficult to find in this\r\ncommunity. These small presses include a number of local authors who are eager to read and discuss their work in the coffeehouse.\r\nSIGNATURE ______________________________________________\r\nDATE\r\nComputing Your Score\r\nDirections:\r\n1.

Taking a practice test under timed conditions\r\nhelps you to estimate the amount of time you can afford to\r\nspend on each question in a section and to determine the\r\nquestion types on which you may need additional practice.\r\nSince the LSAT is a timed test, it is important to use your\r\nallotted time wisely. During the test, you may work only\r\non the section designated by the test supervisor. You\r\ncannot devote extra time to a difficult section and make up\r\nthat time on a section you find easier. In pacing yourself,\r\nand checking your answers, you should think of each\r\nsection of the test as a separate minitest.\r\nBe sure that you answer every question on the test.\r\nWhen you do not know the correct answer to a question,\r\nfirst eliminate the responses that you know are incorrect,\r\nthen make your best guess among the remaining choices.\r\nDo not be afraid to guess as there is no penalty for\r\nincorrect answers.\r\nWhen you take the sample test that follows, abide by all\r\nthe requirements specified in the directions and keep\r\nstrictly within the specified time limits. Work without a\r\nrest period. When you take an actual test you will have\r\nonly a short break—usually 10-15  minutes—after\r\nSECTION III. When taken under conditions as much like\r\nactual testing conditions as possible, the sample test\r\nprovides very useful preparation for taking the LSAT.\r\nOfficial directions for the four multiple-choice sections\r\nand the writing sample are included in this sample test so\r\nthat you can approximate actual testing conditions as you\r\npractice. To take the test:\r\nc110 Set a timer for 35 minutes. Answer all the questions in\r\nSECTION I. Stop working on that section when the 35\r\nminutes have elapsed.\r\nc110 Repeat, allowing yourself 35 minutes each for sections\r\nII, III, and IV.\r\nc110 Set the timer for 30 minutes, then prepare your\r\nresponse to the writing sample at the end of this test.\r\nc110 Refer to “Computing Your Score” on page 120 in this\r\nbook for instruction on evaluating your performance.\r\nAn answer key is provided for this purpose.\r\nHow This Sample Test Differs From an Actual LSAT\r\nThis sample test is made up of the scored sections and\r\nwriting sample from the actual disclosed LSAT administered\r\nin October 1996. However, it does not contain the extra,\r\nvariable section that is used to pretest new test items of one\r\nof the three question types. The three LSAT question types\r\nmay be in a different order in an actual LSAT than in this\r\nsample test. This is because the order of the question types\r\nis intentionally varied for each administration of the test.\r\nThe actual test contains section headers at the top of\r\neach page that are not included in this sample test.\r\nThe Writing Exercise\r\nTest takers are given 30 minutes to complete the brief writ-\r\ning exercise, which is not scored but is used by law school\r\nadmission personnel to assess writing skill. Read the topic\r\ncarefully. You will probably find it best to spend a few\r\nminutes considering the topic and organizing your\r\nthoughts before you begin writing. Do not write on a\r\ntopic other than the one specified. Writing on a topic of\r\nyour own choice is not acceptable.\r\nThere is no “right” or “wrong” position on the writing\r\nsample topic. Law schools are interested in how skillfully\r\nyou support the position you take and how clearly you\r\nexpress that position. How well you write is much more\r\nimportant than how much you write. No special\r\nknowledge is required or expected. Law schools are\r\ninterested in organization, vocabulary, and writing\r\nmechanics. They understand the short time available to\r\nyou and the pressure under which you are writing.\r\nConfine your writing to the lined area following the\r\nwriting sample topic. You will find that you have enough\r\nspace if you plan your writing carefully, write on every\r\nline, avoid wide margins, and keep your handwriting a\r\nreasonable size. Be sure that your handwriting is legible.\r\nScratch paper is provided for use during the writing\r\nsample portion of the test only. Scratch paper cannot be\r\nused in other sections of the LSAT.\r\nThe writing sample is photocopied and sent to law\r\nschools to which you direct your LSAT score.\r\nSome writing sample prompts, or variations of them,\r\nmay be given at more than one LSAT administration. A\r\ncollection of 50 representative writing sample prompts is\r\nincluded in LSAT:  The Official TriplePrep Plus, published\r\nby LSAC.\r\n88\r\nSECTION I\r\nTime—35 minutes\r\n25 Questions\r\nDirections: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some\r\nquestions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that\r\nis, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by\r\ncommonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,\r\nblacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.\r\n1. French divers recently found a large cave along the\r\ncoast of the Mediterranean Sea. The cave is accessible\r\nonly through an underwater tunnel. The interior of the\r\ncave is completely filled with seawater and contains\r\nnumerous large stalagmites, which are stony pillars\r\nthat form when drops of water fall repeatedly on a\r\nsingle spot on a cave floor, leaving behind mineral\r\ndeposits that accumulate over time.\r\nThe information above most strongly supports\r\nwhich one of the following?\r\n(A) The Mediterranean Sea was at a higher level in\r\nthe past than it is now.\r\n(B) The water level within the cave is higher now\r\nthan it once was.\r\n(C) The French divers were the first people who knew\r\nthat the tunnel leading to the cave existed.\r\n(D) There was once an entrance to the cave besides\r\nthe underwater tunnel.\r\n(E) Seawater in the Mediterranean has a lower\r\nmineral content now than it had when the\r\nstalagmites were being formed.\r\n2. A director of the Rexx Pharmaceutical Company argued\r\nthat the development costs for new vaccines that the\r\nhealth department has requested should be subsidized by\r\nthe government, since the marketing of vaccines\r\npromised to be less profitable than the marketing of any\r\nother pharmaceutical product. In support of this claim\r\nthe director argued that sales of vaccines are likely to be\r\nlower since each vaccine is administered to a patient\r\nonly once, whereas medicines that combat diseases and\r\nchronic illnesses are administered many times to each\r\npatient.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most weakens the\r\nsupport offered by the company director for the claim\r\nconcerning the marketing of vaccines?\r\n(A) Vaccines are administered to many more people\r\nthan are most other pharmaceutical products.\r\n(B) Many of the diseases that vaccines are designed\r\nto prevent can be successfully treated by\r\nmedicines.\r\n(C) Pharmaceutical companies occasionally market\r\nproducts that are neither medicines nor vaccines.\r\n(D) Pharmaceutical companies other than the Rexx\r\nPharmaceutical Company produce vaccines.\r\n(E) The cost of administering a vaccine is rarely\r\nborne by the pharmaceutical company that\r\nmanufactures that vaccine.\r\n3. Manager: Our new computer network, the purpose of\r\nwhich is to increase productivity, can be installed\r\nduring the day, which would disrupt our\r\nemployees’ work, or else at night, which would\r\nentail much higher installation charges. Since\r\nsaving money is important, we should have the\r\nnetwork installed during the day.\r\nThe manager’s argument assumes which one of the\r\nfollowing?\r\n(A) The monetary value of the network equipment\r\nwould not exceed the cost of having the\r\nequipment installed at night.\r\n(B) The monetary value of any productivity lost\r\nduring a daytime installation would be less\r\nthan the difference between daytime and\r\nnighttime installation costs.\r\n(C) A daytime installation would be completed by\r\nno larger a crew and would take the crew no\r\nmore time than would a nighttime installation.\r\n(D) Once the network has been installed, most of the\r\ncompany’s employees will be able to use it\r\nimmediately to increase their productivity.\r\n(E) Most of the company’s employees would be\r\nable to work productively while a daytime\r\ninstallation is in progress.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n89\r\n4. An ingredient in marijuana known as THC has been\r\nfound to inactivate herpesviruses in experiments. In\r\nprevious experiments researchers found that inactivated\r\nherpesviruses can convert healthy cells into cancer cells.\r\nIt can be concluded that the use of marijuana can cause\r\ncancer.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most seriously\r\nweakens the argument?\r\n(A) Several teams of scientists performed the various\r\nexperiments and all of the teams had similar\r\nresults.\r\n(B) The carcinogenic effect of THC could be\r\nneutralized by the other ingredients found in\r\nmarijuana.\r\n(C) When THC kills herpesviruses it weakens the\r\nimmune system, and it might thus diminish the\r\nbody’s ability to fight other viruses, including\r\nviruses linked to cancers.\r\n(D) If chemists modify the structure of THC, THC\r\ncan be safely incorporated into medications to\r\nprevent herpes.\r\n(E) To lessen the undesirable side effects of\r\nchemotherapy, the use of marijuana has been\r\nrecommended for cancer patients who are free of\r\nthe herpesvirus.\r\n5. Archaeologist: A large corporation has recently offered\r\nto provide funding to restore an archaeological site\r\nand to construct facilities to make the site readily\r\naccessible to the general public. The restoration will\r\nconform to the best current theories about\r\nhow the site appeared at the height of the ancient\r\ncivilization that occupied it. This offer should be\r\nrejected, however, because many parts of the site\r\ncontain unexamined evidence.\r\nWhich one of the following principles, if valid, justifies\r\nthe archaeologist’s argument?\r\n(A) The ownership of archaeological sites should not\r\nbe under the control of business interests.\r\n(B) Any restoration of an archaeological site should\r\nrepresent only the most ancient period of that\r\nsite’s history.\r\n(C) No one should make judgments about what\r\nconstitutes the height of another civilization.\r\n(D) Only those with a true concern for an\r\narchaeological site’s history should be involved\r\nin the restoration of that site.\r\n(E) The risk of losing evidence relevant to possible\r\nfuture theories should outweigh any advantages\r\nof displaying the results of theories already\r\ndeveloped.\r\n6. Besides laying eggs in her own nest, any female wood\r\nduck will lay an egg in the nest of another female wood\r\nduck if she sees the other duck leaving her nest. Under\r\nnatural nesting conditions, this parasitic behavior is\r\nrelatively rare because the ducks’ nests are well hidden.\r\nHowever, when people put up nesting boxes to help the\r\nducks breed, they actually undercut the ducks’\r\nreproductive efforts. These nesting boxes become so\r\ncrowded with extra eggs that few, if any, of the eggs in\r\nthose boxes hatch.\r\nThe statements above, if true, most strongly support\r\nwhich one of the following?\r\n(A) Female wood ducks will establish nests in nest\r\nboxes only when natural nesting sites are not\r\navailable.\r\n(B) Nesting female wood ducks who often see other\r\nfemale wood ducks are the most successful in\r\ntheir breeding efforts.\r\n(C) The nesting boxes for wood ducks have less space\r\nfor eggs than do natural nesting sites.\r\n(D) The nesting boxes would be more effective in\r\nhelping wood ducks breed if they were less\r\nvisible to other wood ducks than they currently\r\nare.\r\n(E) Nesting boxes are needed to supplement the\r\nnatural nesting sites of wood ducks because of\r\nthe destruction of much of the ducks’ habitat.\r\n7. The crux of creativity resides in the ability to\r\nmanufacture variations on a theme. If we look at the\r\nhistory of science, for instance, we see that every idea is\r\nbuilt upon a thousand related ideas. Careful analysis\r\nleads us to understand that what we choose to call a new\r\ntheme or a new discovery is itself always and without\r\nexception some sort of variation, on a deep level, of\r\nprevious themes.\r\nIf all of the statements in the passage are true, each of\r\nthe following must also be true EXCEPT:\r\n(A) A lack of ability to manufacture a variation on a\r\nprevious theme connotes a lack of creativity.\r\n(B) No scientific idea is entirely independent of all\r\nother ideas.\r\n(C) Careful analysis of a specific variation can reveal\r\nprevious themes of which it is a variation.\r\n(D) All great scientific discoverers have been able to\r\nmanufacture a variation on a theme.\r\n(E) Some new scientific discoveries do not represent,\r\non a deep level, a variation on previous themes.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n8. Millions of female bats rear their pups in Bracken Cave.\r\nAlthough the mothers all leave the cave nightly, on their\r\nreturn each mother is almost always swiftly reunited\r\nwith her own pup. Since the bats’ calls are their only\r\nmeans of finding one another, and a bat pup cannot\r\ndistinguish the call of its mother from that of any other\r\nadult bat, it is clear that each mother bat can recognize\r\nthe call of her pup.\r\nThe argument seeks to do which one of the following?\r\n(A) derive a general conclusion about all members of\r\na group from facts known about representative\r\nmembers of that group\r\n(B) establish the validity of one explanation for a\r\nphenomenon by excluding alternative\r\nexplanations\r\n(C) support, by describing a suitable mechanism, the\r\nhypothesis that a certain phenomenon can occur\r\n(D) conclude that members of two groups are likely to\r\nshare a certain ability because of other\r\ncharacteristics they share\r\n(E) demonstrate that a general rule applies in a\r\nparticular case\r\n9. Someone who gets sick from eating a meal will often\r\ndevelop a strong distaste for the one food in the meal\r\nthat had the most distinctive flavor, whether or not that\r\nfood caused the sickness. This phenomenon explains\r\nwhy children are especially likely to develop strong\r\naversions to some foods.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, provides the\r\nstrongest support for the explanation?\r\n(A) Children are more likely than adults to be given\r\nmeals composed of foods lacking especially\r\ndistinctive flavors.\r\n(B) Children are less likely than adults to see a\r\nconnection between their health and the foods\r\nthey eat.\r\n(C) Children tend to have more acute taste and to\r\nbecome sick more often than adults do.\r\n(D) Children typically recover more slowly than\r\nadults do from sickness caused by food.\r\n(E) Children are more likely than are adults to refuse\r\nto eat unfamiliar foods.\r\n10. Premiums for automobile accident insurance are often\r\nhigher for red cars than for cars of other colors. To\r\njustify these higher charges, insurance companies claim\r\nthat, overall, a greater percentage of red cars are\r\ninvolved in accidents than are cars of any other color. If\r\nthis claim is true, then lives could undoubtedly be saved\r\nby banning red cars from the roads altogether.\r\nThe reasoning in the argument is flawed because\r\nthe argument\r\n(A) accepts without question that insurance\r\ncompanies have the right to charge higher\r\npremiums for higher-risk clients\r\n(B) fails to consider whether red cars cost the same to\r\nrepair as cars of other colors\r\n(C) ignores the possibility that drivers who drive\r\nrecklessly have a preference for red cars\r\n(D) does not specify precisely what percentage of red\r\ncars are involved in accidents\r\n(E) makes an unsupported assumption that every\r\nautomobile accident results in some loss of life\r\n11. A certain credit-card company awards its customers\r\nbonus points for using its credit card. Customers can\r\nuse accumulated points in the purchase of brand name\r\nmerchandise by mail at prices lower than the\r\nmanufacturers’ suggested retail prices. At any given\r\ntime, therefore, customers who purchase merchandise\r\nusing the bonus points spend less than they would spend\r\nif they purchased the same merchandise in retail stores.\r\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which\r\nthe argument depends?\r\n(A) The merchandise that can be ordered by mail\r\nusing the bonus points is not offered at lower\r\nprices by other credit-card companies that award\r\nbonus points.\r\n(B) The bonus points cannot be used by the credit-\r\ncard customers in the purchase of brand name\r\nmerchandise that is not available for purchase in\r\nretail stores.\r\n(C) The credit-card company does not require its\r\ncustomers to accumulate a large number of\r\nbonus points before becoming eligible to order\r\nmerchandise at prices lower than the\r\nmanufacturers’ suggested retail price.\r\n(D) The amount credit-card customers pay for\r\nshipping the merchandise ordered by mail does\r\nnot increase the amount customers spend to an\r\namount greater than they would spend if they\r\npurchased the same merchandise in retail stores.\r\n(E) The merchandise available to the company’s\r\ncredit-card customers using the bonus points\r\nis frequently sold in retail stores at prices that are\r\nhigher than the manufacturers’ suggested retail\r\nprices.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n90\r\n91\r\n12. It is probably not true that colic in infants is caused by\r\nthe inability of those infants to tolerate certain antibodies\r\nfound in cow’s milk, since it is often the case that\r\nsymptoms of colic are shown by infants that are fed\r\nbreast milk exclusively.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most seriously\r\nweakens the argument?\r\n(A) A study involving 500 sets of twins has found\r\nthat if one infant has colic, its twin will probably\r\nalso have colic.\r\n(B) Symptoms of colic generally disappear as infants\r\ngrow older, whether the infants have been fed\r\nbreast milk exclusively or have been fed infant\r\nformula containing cow’s milk.\r\n(C) In a study of 5,000 infants who were fed only\r\ninfant formula containing cow’s milk, over\r\n4,000 of the infants never displayed any\r\nsymptoms of colic.\r\n(D) When mothers of infants that are fed only breast\r\nmilk eliminate cow’s milk and all products made\r\nfrom cow’s milk from their own diets, any colic\r\nsymptoms that their infants have manifested\r\nquickly disappear.\r\n(E) Infants that are fed breast milk develop mature\r\ndigestive systems at an earlier age than do those\r\nthat are fed infant formulas, and infants with\r\nmature digestive systems are better able to\r\ntolerate certain proteins and antibodies found in\r\ncow’s milk.\r\nQuestions 13–14\r\nYolanda: Gaining access to computers without\r\nauthorization and manipulating the data and\r\nprograms they contain is comparable to joyriding\r\nin stolen cars; both involve breaking into private\r\nproperty and treating it recklessly. Joyriding,\r\nhowever, is the more dangerous crime because it\r\nphysically endangers people, whereas only\r\nintellectual property is harmed in the case of\r\ncomputer crimes.\r\nArjun: I disagree! For example, unauthorized use of\r\nmedical records systems in hospitals could\r\ndamage data systems on which human lives\r\ndepend, and therefore computer crimes also\r\ncause physical harm to people.\r\n13. An issue in dispute between Yolanda and Arjun is\r\n(A) whether joyriding physically endangers human\r\nlives\r\n(B) whether the unauthorized manipulation of\r\ncomputer data involves damage to private\r\nproperty\r\n(C) whether damage to physical property is more\r\ncriminal than damage to intellectual property\r\n(D) whether the unauthorized use of computers is as\r\ndangerous to people as is joyriding\r\n(E) whether treating private property recklessly is\r\never a dangerous crime\r\n14. The reasoning in Arjun’s response is flawed because he\r\n(A) fails to maintain a distinction made in Yolanda’s\r\nargument\r\n(B) denies Yolanda’s conclusion without providing\r\nevidence against it\r\n(C) relies on the actuality of a phenomenon that he\r\nhas only shown to be possible\r\n(D) mistakes something that leads to his conclusion\r\nfor something that is necessary for his\r\nconclusion\r\n(E) uses as evidence a phenomenon that is\r\ninconsistent with his own conclusion\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n92\r\n15. A report of a government survey concluded that Center\r\nCity was among the ten cities in the nation with the\r\nhighest dropout rate from its schools. The survey data\r\nwere obtained by asking all city residents over the age of\r\n19 whether they were high school graduates and\r\ncomputing the proportion who were not. A city school\r\nofficial objected that the result did not seem accurate\r\naccording to the schools’ figures.\r\nThe school official can most properly criticize the\r\nreasoning by which the survey report reached its result\r\nfor failure to do which one of the following?\r\n(A) take into account instances of respondents’\r\ndropping out that occurred before the\r\nrespondents reached high school\r\n(B) ask residents whether they had completed their\r\nhigh school work in fewer than the usual number\r\nof years\r\n(C) distinguish between residents who had\r\nattended the city’s schools and those who had\r\nreceived their schooling elsewhere\r\n(D) predict the effect of the information contained in\r\nthe report on future high school dropout rates\r\nfor the city\r\n(E) consider whether a diploma from the city’s high\r\nschools signaled the same level of achievement\r\nover time\r\n16. Brown dwarfs—dim red stars that are too cool to burn\r\nhydrogen—are very similar in appearance to red dwarf\r\nstars, which are just hot enough to burn hydrogen. Stars,\r\nwhen first formed, contain substantial amounts of the\r\nelement lithium. All stars but the coolest of the brown\r\ndwarfs are hot enough to destroy lithium completely by\r\nconverting it to helium. Accordingly, any star found that\r\ncontains no lithium is not one of these coolest brown\r\ndwarfs.\r\nThe argument depends on assuming which one of the\r\nfollowing?\r\n(A) None of the coolest brown dwarfs has ever been\r\nhot enough to destroy lithium.\r\n(B) Most stars that are too cool to burn hydrogen\r\nare too cool to destroy lithium completely.\r\n(C) Brown dwarfs that are not hot enough to destroy\r\nlithium are hot enough to destroy helium.\r\n(D) Most stars, when first formed, contain roughly the\r\nsame percentage of lithium.\r\n(E) No stars are more similar in appearance to red\r\ndwarfs than are brown dwarfs.\r\n17. Whenever a company loses a major product-liability\r\nlawsuit, the value of the company’s stocks falls\r\nsignificantly within hours after the announcement. Cotoy\r\nhas long been involved in a major product-liability\r\nlawsuit, and its stocks fell significantly in value today.\r\nTherefore, we can be sure that an unfavorable judgment\r\nagainst Cotoy in that lawsuit was announced earlier\r\ntoday.\r\nWhich one of the following contains flawed reasoning\r\nthat most closely parallels that in the argument above?\r\n(A) Whenever a business treats its customers\r\ndiscourteously, its customers begin to shop\r\nelsewhere. Shopwell wants to keep all of its\r\ncustomers; therefore, its employees will never\r\ntreat customers discourteously.\r\n(B) Whenever the large airlines decrease fares, the\r\nfinancial stability of smaller competing airlines\r\nis adversely affected. Therefore, the smaller\r\ncompeting airlines’ financial stability must be\r\nseriously threatened when the large airlines\r\nannounce a large price decrease.\r\n(C) Whenever a country shows a lack of leadership\r\non international issues, respect for the country’s\r\npolicies begins to decline.

In recent years the climate has been generally cool in\r\nnorthern Asia. But during periods when the average\r\ndaily temperature and humidity in northern Asia were\r\nslightly higher than their normal levels the yields of most\r\ncrops grown there increased significantly. In the next\r\ncentury, the increased average daily temperature and\r\nhumidity attained during those periods are expected to\r\nbecome the norm. Yet scientists predict that the yearly\r\nyields of most of the region’s crops will decrease during\r\nthe next century.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve\r\nthe apparent paradox in the information above?\r\n(A) Crop yields in southern Asia are expected to\r\nremain constant even after the average daily\r\ntemperature and humidity there increase from\r\nrecent levels.\r\n(B) Any increases in temperature and humidity would\r\nbe accompanied by higher levels of atmospheric\r\ncarbon dioxide, which is vital to plant\r\nrespiration.\r\n(C) The climate in northern Asia has generally been\r\ntoo cool and dry in recent years for populations\r\nof many crop insect pests to become established.\r\n(D) In many parts of Asia, the increased annual\r\nprecipitation that would result from warmer and\r\nwetter climates would cause most edible plant\r\nspecies to flourish.\r\n(E) The recent climate of northern Asia prevents\r\nmany crops from being farmed there during the\r\nwinter.\r\n19. No one in the French department to which Professor\r\nAlban belongs is allowed to teach more than one\r\nintroductory level class in any one term. Moreover, the\r\nonly language classes being taught next term are\r\nadvanced ones. So it is untrue that both of the French\r\nclasses Professor Alban will be teaching next term will\r\nbe introductory level classes.\r\nThe pattern of reasoning displayed in the argument\r\nabove is most closely paralleled by that in which one of\r\nthe following arguments?\r\n(A) The Morrison Building will be fully occupied by\r\nMay and since if a building is occupied by May\r\nthe new tax rates apply to it, the Morrison\r\nBuilding will be taxed according to the new\r\nrates.\r\n(B) The revised tax code does not apply at all to\r\nbuildings built before 1900, and only the first\r\nsection of the revised code applies to buildings\r\nbuilt between 1900 and 1920, so the revised\r\ncode does not apply to the Norton Building,\r\nsince it was built in 1873.\r\n(C) All property on Overton Road will be\r\nreassessed for tax purposes by the end of the\r\nyear and the Elnor Company headquarters is\r\non Overton Road, so Elnor’s property taxes\r\nwill be higher next year.\r\n(D) New buildings that include public space are\r\nexempt from city taxes for two years and all new\r\nbuildings in the city’s Alton district are exempt\r\nfor five years, so the building with the large\r\npublic space that was recently completed in\r\nAlton will not be subject to city taxes next year.\r\n(E) Since according to recent statute, a building that\r\nis exempt from property taxes is charged for\r\ncity water at a special rate, and hospitals are\r\nexempt from property taxes, Founder’s\r\nHospital will be charged for city water at the\r\nspecial rate.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n94\r\nQuestions 20–21\r\nSome people have been promoting a new herbal mixture\r\nas a remedy for the common cold. The mixture contains,\r\namong other things, extracts of the plants purple cone-\r\nflower and goldenseal. A cold sufferer, skeptical of the\r\nclaim that the mixture is an effective cold remedy, argued,\r\n“Suppose that the mixture were an effective cold remedy.\r\nSince most people with colds wish to recover quickly, it\r\nfollows that almost everybody with a cold would be using\r\nit. Therefore, since there are many people who have colds\r\nbut do not use the mixture, it is obviously not effective.”\r\n20. Each of the following is an assumption required by\r\nthe skeptical cold sufferer’s argument EXCEPT:\r\n(A) Enough of the mixture is produced to provide the\r\nrequired doses to almost everybody with a cold.\r\n(B) The mixture does not have side effects severe\r\nenough to make many people who have colds\r\navoid using it.\r\n(C) The mixture is powerful enough to prevent\r\nalmost everybody who uses it from\r\ncontracting any further colds.\r\n(D) The mixture is widely enough known that\r\nalmost everybody with a cold is aware of it.\r\n(E) There are no effective cold remedies available\r\nthat many people who have colds prefer to the\r\nmixture.\r\n21. Which one of the following most accurately describes\r\nthe method of reasoning the cold sufferer uses to\r\nreach the conclusion of the argument?\r\n(A) finding a claim to be false on the grounds that it\r\nwould if true have consequences that are false\r\n(B) accepting a claim on the basis of public opinion\r\nof the claim\r\n(C) showing that conditions necessary to establish\r\nthe truth of a claim are met\r\n(D) basing a generalization on a representative\r\ngroup of instances\r\n(E) showing that a measure claimed to be effective\r\nin achieving a certain effect would actually\r\nmake achieving the effect more difficult\r\n22. To hold criminals responsible for their crimes\r\ninvolves a failure to recognize that criminal actions,\r\nlike all actions, are ultimately products of the\r\nenvironment that forged the agent’s character. It is\r\nnot criminals but people in the law-abiding majority\r\nwho by their actions do most to create and maintain\r\nthis environment. Therefore, it is law-abiding people\r\nwhose actions, and nothing else, make them alone\r\ntruly responsible for crime.\r\nThe reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to\r\ncriticism on the grounds that\r\n(A) it exploits an ambiguity in the term\r\n“environment” by treating two different\r\nmeanings of the word as though they were\r\nequivalent\r\n(B) it fails to distinguish between actions that are\r\nsocially acceptable and actions that are socially\r\nunacceptable\r\n(C) the way it distinguishes criminals from crimes\r\nimplicitly denies that someone becomes a\r\ncriminal solely in virtue of having committed a\r\ncrime\r\n(D) its conclusion is a generalization of statistical\r\nevidence drawn from only a small minority of\r\nthe population\r\n(E) its conclusion contradicts an implicit principle on\r\nwhich an earlier part of the argument is based\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n95\r\n23. Chronic back pain is usually caused by a herniated or\r\ndegenerated spinal disk. In most cases the disk will\r\nhave been damaged years before chronic pain\r\ndevelops, and in fact an estimated one in five people\r\nover the age of 30 has a herniated or degenerated\r\ndisk that shows no chronic symptoms. If chronic pain\r\nlater develops in such a case, it is generally brought\r\nabout by a deterioration of the abdominal and spinal\r\nmuscles caused by insufficient exercise.\r\nThe statements above, if true, most strongly support\r\nwhich one of the following?\r\n(A) Four out of five people over the age of 30 can be\r\nsure they will never develop chronic back pain.\r\n(B) People who exercise their abdominal and spinal\r\nmuscles regularly are sure to be free from\r\nchronic back pain.\r\n(C) Patients rarely suffer even mild and fleeting\r\nback pain at the time that a spinal disk first\r\nbecomes herniated or degenerated.\r\n(D) Doctors can accurately predict which people\r\nwho do not have chronic back pain will\r\ndevelop it in the future.\r\n(E) There is a strategy that can be effective in\r\ndelaying or preventing the onset of pain from\r\na currently asymptomatic herniated or\r\ndegenerated spinal disk.\r\n24.

Yet his genius has never received its due. The\r\nimpatience and artistic restlessness that characterized\r\n(5) his work spawned one stylistic turn after another and\r\nmade Davis anathema to many critics, who deplored\r\nhis abandonment first of bebop and then of “cool”\r\nacoustic jazz for ever more innovative sounds.\r\nHaving begun his career studying bebop, Davis\r\n(10) pulled the first of many stylistic surprises when, in\r\n1948, he became a member of an impromptu musical\r\nthink tank that gathered in a New York City apartment.\r\nThe work of this group not only slowed down tempos\r\nand featured ensemble playing as much as or even\r\n(15) more than solos—in direct reaction to bebop—it also\r\nbecame the seedbed for the “West Coast cool” jazz\r\nstyle.\r\nIn what would become a characteristic zigzag,\r\nDavis didn’t follow up on these innovations himself.\r\n(20) Instead, in the late 1950s he formed a new band that\r\nbroke free from jazz’s restrictive pattern of chord\r\nchanges. Soloists could determine the shapes of their\r\nmelodies without referring back to the same unvarying\r\nrepetition of chords. In this period, Davis attempted to\r\n(25) join jazz phrasings, harmonies, and tonal qualities with\r\na unified and integrated sound similar to that of a\r\nclassical orchestral piece: in his recordings the\r\nrhythms, no matter how jazzlike, are always\r\nunderstated, and the instrumental voicings seem muted.\r\n(30) Davis’s recordings from the late 1960s signal that,\r\nonce again, his direction was changing. On Filles de\r\nKilimanjaro, Davis’s request that keyboardist Herbie\r\nHancock play electric rather than acoustic piano caused\r\nconsternation among jazz purists of the time. Other\r\n(35) albums featured rock-style beats, heavily electronic\r\ninstrumentation, a loose improvisational attack and a\r\ngrowing use of studio editing to create jagged\r\nsoundscapes. By 1969 Davis’s typical studio procedure\r\nwas to have musicians improvise from a base script of\r\n(40) material and then to build finished pieces out of tape,\r\nlike a movie director. Rock groups had pioneered the\r\nprocess; to jazz lovers, raised on the ideal of live\r\nimprovisation, that approach was a violation of the\r\npremise that recordings should simply document the\r\n(45) musicians’ thought processes in real time. Davis again\r\nbecame the target of fierce polemics by purist jazz\r\ncritics, who have continued to belittle his contributions\r\nto jazz.\r\nWhat probably underlies the intensity of the\r\n(50) reactions against Davis is fear of the broadening of\r\npossibilities that he exemplified. Ironically, he was\r\nsimply doing what jazz explorers have always done:\r\nreaching for something new that was his own. But\r\nbecause his career endured, because he didn’t die\r\n(55) young or record only sporadically, and because he\r\nrefused to dwell in whatever niche he had previously\r\ncarved out, critics find it difficult to definitively rank\r\nDavis in the aesthetic hierarchy to which they cling.\r\n1. Which one of the following best states the main point\r\nof the passage?\r\n(A) Because the career of Miles Davis was\r\ncharacterized by frequent shifts in styles, he\r\nnever fulfilled his musical potential.\r\n(B) Because the career of Miles Davis does not fit\r\nneatly into their preconceptions about the life\r\nand music of jazz musicians, jazz critics have\r\nnot accorded him the appreciation he deserves.\r\n(C) Because the career of Miles Davis was unusually\r\nlong and productive, he never received the\r\npopular acclaim generally reserved for artists\r\nwith more tragic life histories.\r\n(D) The long and productive career of Miles Davis\r\nspawned most of the major stylistic changes\r\naffecting twentieth-century jazz.\r\n(E) Miles Davis’s versatility and openness have\r\ninspired the admiration of most jazz critics.\r\n2. According to the passage, which one of the following\r\nis true of the “West Coast cool” jazz style?\r\n(A) It was popularized by Miles Davis.\r\n(B) It was characterized by a unified and integrated\r\nsound.\r\n(C) It was played primarily by large ensembles.\r\n(D) It introduced a wide variety of chord change\r\npatterns.\r\n(E) It grew out of innovations developed in New\r\nYork City.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n3. The passage suggests which one of the following about\r\nthe kind of jazz played by Miles Davis prior to 1948?\r\n(A) It was characterized by rapid tempos and an\r\nemphasis on solo playing.\r\n(B) It equally balanced ensemble and solo playing.\r\n(C) It was a reaction against more restrictive jazz\r\nstyles.\r\n(D) It is regarded by purist jazz critics as the only\r\nauthentic jazz style.\r\n(E) It was played primarily in New York City jazz\r\nclubs.\r\n4. Which one of the following best describes the author’s\r\nattitude toward Miles Davis’s music?\r\n(A) uneasy ambivalence\r\n(B) cautious neutrality\r\n(C) grudging respect\r\n(D) moderate commendation\r\n(E) appreciative advocacy\r\n5. Which one of the following creative processes is most\r\nsimilar to Miles Davis’s typical studio procedure of the\r\nlate 1960s, as described in the fourth paragraph of the\r\npassage?\r\n(A) The producer of a television comedy show\r\nsuggests a setting and general topic for a comedy\r\nsketch and then lets the comedians write their\r\nown script.\r\n(B) An actor digresses from the written script and\r\nimprovises during a monologue in order to\r\nintroduce a feeling of spontaneity to the\r\nperformance.\r\n(C) A conductor rehearses each section of the\r\norchestra separately before assembling them to\r\nrehearse the entire piece together.\r\n(D) An artist has several photographers take pictures\r\npertaining to a certain assigned theme and then\r\nassembles them into a pictorial collage.\r\n(E) A teacher has each student in a writing class\r\nwrite an essay on an assigned topic and then\r\nsubmits the best essays to be considered for\r\npublication in a journal.\r\n6. Which one of the following, if true, would\r\nmost undermine the author’s explanation for\r\nthe way Miles Davis is regarded by jazz critics?\r\n(A) Many jazz musicians who specialize in\r\nimprovisational playing are greatly admired\r\nby jazz critics.\r\n(B) Many jazz musicians whose careers have been\r\ncharacterized by several radical changes in style\r\nare greatly admired by jazz critics.\r\n(C) Several jazz musicians who perform exclusively\r\non electronic instruments are very highly\r\nregarded by jazz critics.\r\n(D) The jazz innovators who are held in the highest\r\nregard by jazz critics had brief yet brilliant\r\ncareers.\r\n(E) Jazz critics are known to have a higher regard for\r\nmusicality than for mere technical virtuosity.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n97\r\n98\r\nBy the mid-fourteenth century, professional\r\nassociations of canon lawyers (legal advocates in\r\nChristian ecclesiastical courts, which dealt with cases\r\ninvolving marriage, inheritance, and other issues) had\r\n(5) appeared in most of Western Europe, and a body of\r\nprofessional standards had been defined for them. One\r\nmight expect that the professional associations would\r\nplay a prominent role in enforcing these standards of\r\nconduct, as other guilds often did, and as modern\r\n(10) professional associations do, but that seems not to have\r\nhappened. Advocates’ professional organizations\r\nshowed little fervor for disciplining their erring\r\nmembers. Some even attempted to hobble efforts at\r\nenforcement. The Florentine guild of lawyers, for\r\n(15) example, forbade its members to play any role in\r\ndisciplinary proceedings against other guild members.\r\nIn the few recorded episodes of disciplinary\r\nenforcement, the initiative for disciplinary action\r\napparently came from a dissatisfied client, not from\r\n(20) fellow lawyers.\r\nAt first glance, there seem to be two possible\r\nexplanations for the rarity of disciplinary proceedings.\r\nMedieval canon lawyers may have generally observed\r\nthe standards of professional conduct scrupulously.\r\n(25) Alternatively, it is possible that deviations from the\r\nestablished standards of behavior were not uncommon,\r\nbut that canonical disciplinary mechanisms were so\r\ninefficient that most delinquents escaped detection and\r\npunishment.\r\n(30) Two considerations make it clear that the second of\r\nthese explanations is more plausible. First, the English\r\ncivil law courts, whose ethical standards were similar\r\nto those of ecclesiastical courts, show many more\r\nexamples of disciplinary actions against legal\r\n(35) practitioners than do the records of church courts. This\r\ndiscrepancy could well indicate that the disciplinary\r\nmechanisms of the civil courts functioned more\r\nefficiently than those of the church courts. The\r\nalternative inference, namely, that ecclesiastical\r\n(40) advocates were less prone to ethical lapses than their\r\ncounterparts in the civil courts, seems inherently weak,\r\nespecially since there was some overlap of personnel\r\nbetween the civil bar and the ecclesiastical bar.\r\nSecond, church authorities themselves complained\r\n(45) about the failure of advocates to measure up to ethical\r\nstandards and deplored the shortcomings of the\r\ndisciplinary system. Thus the Council of Basel\r\ndeclared that canon lawyers failed to adhere to the\r\nethical prescriptions laid down in numerous papal\r\n(50) constitutions and directed Cardinal Cesarini to address\r\nthe problem. In England, where medieval church\r\nrecords are extraordinarily rich, similar complaints\r\nabout the failure of the disciplinary system to reform\r\nunethical practices were very common.\r\n(55) Such criticisms seem to have had a paradoxical\r\nresult, for they apparently reinforced the professional\r\nsolidarity of lawyers at the expense of the enforcement\r\nof ethical standards. Thus the profession’s critics may\r\nactually have induced advocates to organize\r\n(60) professional associations for self-defense. The critics’\r\nattacks may also have persuaded lawyers to assign a\r\nhigher priority to defending themselves against attacks\r\nby nonprofessionals than to disciplining wayward\r\nmembers within their own ranks.\r\n7. Which one of the following best states the main\r\nconclusion of the passage?\r\n(A) Professional organizations of medieval canon\r\nlawyers probably only enforced ethical standards\r\namong their own members when provoked to do\r\nso by outside criticisms.\r\n(B) Professional organizations of medieval civil\r\nlawyers seem to have maintained stricter ethical\r\nstandards for their own members than did\r\nprofessional organizations of medieval canon\r\nlawyers.\r\n(C) Professional organizations of medieval canon\r\nlawyers apparently served to defend their\r\nmembers against critics’ attacks rather than to\r\nenforce ethical standards.\r\n(D) The ethical standards maintained by professional\r\nassociations of medieval canon lawyers were\r\nchiefly laid down in papal constitutions.\r\n(E) Ethical standards for medieval canon lawyers\r\nwere not laid down until professional\r\norganizations for these lawyers had been\r\nformed.\r\n8. According to the passage, which one of the following\r\nstatements about law courts in medieval England is true?\r\n(A) Some English lawyers who practiced in civil\r\ncourts also practiced in church courts, but others\r\nserved exclusively in one court or the other.\r\n(B) English canon lawyers were more likely to\r\ninitiate disciplinary proceedings against their\r\ncolleagues than were English civil lawyers.\r\n(C) English civil lawyers maintained more stringent\r\nethical standards than did civil lawyers in the\r\nrest of Europe.\r\n(D) English ecclesiastical courts had originally been\r\nmodeled upon English civil courts.\r\n(E) English ecclesiastical courts kept richer and more\r\nthorough records than did English civil courts.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n9.

The result of\r\nrepeated interactions between flock members is that\r\n(5) each bird gains a particular social status related to its\r\nfighting ability, with priority of access to resources\r\nincreasing with higher status. As the number and\r\nintensity of interactions between birds increase,\r\nhowever, so increase the costs to each bird in terms of\r\n(10) energy expenditure, time, and risk of injury. Thus,\r\nbirds possessing attributes that reduce the number of\r\ncostly interactions in which they must be involved,\r\nwithout leading to a reduction in status, are at an\r\nadvantage. An external signal, such as a plumage type,\r\n(15) announcing fighting ability and thereby obviating the\r\nactual need to fight, could be one such attribute.\r\nThe zoologist Rohwer asserted that plumage\r\nvariations in “Harris sparrows” support the status\r\nsignaling hypothesis (SSH). He reported that almost\r\n(20) without exception birds with darker throats win\r\nconflicts with individuals having lighter plumage. He\r\nclaimed that even among birds of the same age and sex\r\nthe amount of dark plumage predicts relative\r\ndominance status.\r\n(25) However, Rohwer’s data do not support his\r\nassertions: in one of his studies darker birds won only\r\n57 out of 75 conflicts; within another, focusing on\r\nconflicts between birds of the same age group or sex,\r\ndarker birds won 63 and lost 62. There are indications\r\n(30) that plumage probably does signal broad age-related\r\ndifferences in status among Harris sparrows: adults,\r\nusually dark throated, have higher status than juveniles,\r\nwho are usually light throated; moreover, juveniles\r\ndyed to resemble adults are dominant over undyed\r\n(35) juveniles. However, the Harris sparrows’ age-related\r\nplumage differences do not signal the status of\r\nindividual birds within an age class, and thus cannot\r\nproperly be included under the term “status signaling.”\r\nThe best evidence for status signaling is from the\r\n(40) greater titmouse. Experiments show a strong\r\ncorrelation between the width of the black breast-\r\nplumage stripe and status as measured by success in\r\naggressive interactions. An analysis of factors likely to\r\nbe associated with breast-stripe width (sex, age, wing\r\n(45) length, body weight) has demonstrated social status to\r\nbe the only variable that correlates with stripe width\r\nwhen the other variables are held constant.\r\nAn ingenious experiment provided further evidence\r\nfor status signaling in the greater titmouse. One of\r\n(50) three stuffed titmouse dummies was mounted on a\r\nfeeding tray. When a live bird approached, the dummy\r\nwas turned by radio control to face the bird and present\r\nits breast stripe in “display.” When presented with a\r\ndummy having a narrower breast stripe than their own,\r\n(55) birds approached closely and behaved aggressively.\r\nHowever, when presented with a dummy having a\r\nbroader breast stripe than their own, live birds acted\r\nsubmissive and did not approach.\r\n15. According to the passage, the status signaling\r\nhypothesis holds that the ability to display a\r\nrecognizable external signal would have the effect on\r\nan individual bird of\r\n(A) enabling it to attract a mate of high status\r\n(B) allowing it to avoid costly aggressive interactions\r\n(C) decreasing its access to limited resources\r\n(D) making it less attractive to predatory species\r\n(E) increasing its fighting ability\r\n16. The author refers to the fact that adult Harris sparrows\r\nare usually dark throated (lines 31–32), in order to do\r\nwhich one of the following?\r\n(A) support the conclusion that plumage variation\r\namong Harris sparrows probably does not signal\r\nindividual status\r\n(B) argue that plumage variation among Harris\r\nsparrows helps to confirm the status signaling\r\nhypothesis\r\n(C) indicate that in light of plumage variation patterns\r\namong Harris sparrows, the status signaling\r\nhypothesis should probably be modified\r\n(D) demonstrate that Harris sparrows are the most\r\nappropriate subjects for the study of status\r\nsignaling among birds\r\n(E) suggest that the signaling of age-related\r\ndifferences in status is widespread among birds\r\nthat form flocks\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n17. Which one of the following, if true, would most\r\nseriously undermine the validity of the results of the\r\nexperiment discussed in the last paragraph?\r\n(A) The live birds all came from different titmouse\r\nflocks.\r\n(B) The physical characteristics of the stuffed\r\ndummies varied in ways other than just breast-\r\nstripe width.\r\n(C) No live juvenile birds were included in the\r\nexperiment.\r\n(D) The food placed in the feeding tray was not the\r\nkind of food normally eaten by titmice in the\r\nwild.\r\n(E) Even the live birds that acted aggressively did not\r\nactually physically attack the stuffed dummies.\r\n18. Which one of the following best describes the\r\norganization of the passage?\r\n(A) A hypothesis is introduced and studies relevant to\r\nthe hypothesis are discussed and evaluated.\r\n(B) A natural phenomenon is presented and several\r\nexplanations for the phenomenon are examined\r\nin detail.\r\n(C) Behavior is described, possible underlying causes\r\nfor the behavior are reported, and the likelihood\r\nof each cause is assessed.\r\n(D) A scientific conundrum is explained and the\r\nhistory of the issue is recounted.\r\n(E) A scientific theory is outlined and opinions for\r\nand against its validity as well as experiments\r\nsupporting each side are compared.\r\n19. According to the passage, which one of the following\r\nis true of Rohwer’s relationship to the status\r\nsignaling hypothesis (SSH)?\r\n(A) Although his research was designed to test the\r\nSSH, his data proved to be more relevant to\r\nother issues.\r\n(B) He set out to confirm the SSH, but ended up\r\nrevising it.\r\n(C) He set out to disprove the SSH, but ended up\r\naccepting it.\r\n(D) He altered the SSH by expanding it to encompass\r\nvarious types of signals.\r\n(E) He advocated the SSH, but his research data\r\nfailed to confirm it.\r\n20. The passage suggests that among birds that\r\nform flocks, a bird of high status is most\r\nlikely to have which one of the following?\r\n(A) dark throat plumage\r\n(B) greater-than-average body weight\r\n(C) offspring of high status\r\n(D) strong fighting ability\r\n(E) frequent injuries\r\n21. Which one of the following can be inferred about Harris\r\nsparrows from the passage?\r\n(A) Among Harris sparrows, plumage differences\r\nsignal individual status only within age groups.\r\n(B) Among Harris sparrows, adults have priority of\r\naccess to food over juveniles.\r\n(C) Among Harris sparrows, juveniles with relatively\r\ndark plumage have status equal to that of adults\r\nwith relatively light plumage.\r\n(D) Juvenile Harris sparrows engage in aggressive\r\ninteraction more frequently than do adult Harris\r\nsparrows.\r\n(E) Harris sparrows engage in aggressive interaction\r\nless frequently than do greater titmice.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n101\r\n102\r\nIn The Dynamics of Apocalypse, John Lowe\r\nattempts to solve the mystery of the collapse of the\r\nClassic Mayan civilization. Lowe bases his study on a\r\ndetailed examination of the known archaeological\r\n(5) record. Like previous investigators, Lowe relies on\r\ndated monuments to construct a step-by-step account\r\nof the actual collapse. Using the erection of new\r\nmonuments as a means to determine a site’s occupation\r\nspan, Lowe assumes that once new monuments ceased\r\n(10) to be built, a site had been abandoned. Lowe’s analysis\r\nof the evidence suggests that construction of new\r\nmonuments continued to increase between A.D. 672\r\nand 751, but that the civilization stopped expanding\r\ngeographically; new construction took place almost\r\n(15) exclusively in established settlements. The first signs\r\nof trouble followed. Monument inscriptions indicate\r\nthat between 751 and 790, long-standing alliances\r\nstarted to break down. Evidence also indicates that\r\nbetween 790 and 830, the death rate in Classic Mayan\r\n(20) cities outstripped the birthrate. After approximately\r\n830, construction stopped throughout the area, and\r\nwithin a hundred years, the Classic Mayan civilization\r\nall but vanished.\r\nHaving established this chronology, Lowe sets\r\n(25) forth a plausible explanation of the collapse that\r\naccommodates the available archaeological evidence.\r\nHe theorizes that Classic Mayan civilization was\r\nbrought down by the interaction of several factors, set\r\nin motion by population growth. An increase in\r\n(30) population, particularly within the elite segment of\r\nsociety, necessitated ever more intense farming.\r\nAgricultural intensification exerted stress on the soil\r\nand led to a decline in productivity (the amount of food\r\nproduced through each unit of labor invested). At the\r\n(35) same time, the growth of the elite class created\r\nincreasing demands for ceremonial monuments and\r\nluxuries, diverting needed labor from the fields. The\r\ntheory holds that these stresses were communicated—\r\nand amplified—throughout the area as Mayan states\r\n(40) engaged in warfare to acquire laborers and food, and\r\nrefugees fled impoverished areas. The most vulnerable\r\nstates thus began to break down, and each downfall\r\ntriggered others, until the entire civilization collapsed.\r\nIf there is a central flaw in Lowe’s explanation, it is\r\n(45) that the entire edifice rests on the assumption that the\r\navailable evidence paints a true picture of how the\r\ncollapse proceeded. However, it is difficult to know\r\nhow accurately the archaeological record reflects\r\nhistoric activity, especially of a complex civilization\r\n(50) such as the Mayans’, and a hypothesis can be tested\r\nonly against the best available data. It is quite possible\r\nthat our understanding of the collapse might be\r\nradically altered by better data. For example, Lowe’s\r\nassumption about monument construction and the\r\n(55) occupation span of a site might well be disproved if\r\nfurther investigations of Classic Mayan sites\r\nestablished that some remained heavily settled long\r\nafter the custom of carving dynastic monuments had\r\nceased.\r\n22. Which one of the following best describes the\r\norganization of the passage?\r\n(A) A method used to analyze evidence is described,\r\nan explanation of the evidence is suggested, and\r\nthen a conclusion is drawn from the evidence.\r\n(B) A hypothesis is presented, evidence supporting\r\nthe hypothesis is provided, and then the\r\nhypothesis is affirmed.\r\n(C) An analysis of a study is presented, contradictory\r\nevidence is examined, and then a direction for\r\nfuture studies is suggested.\r\n(D) The basis of a study is described, a theory that\r\nexplains the available evidence is presented, and\r\na possible flaw in the study is pointed out.\r\n(E) An observation is made, evidence supporting the\r\nobservation is presented, and then contradictions\r\nin the evidence are discussed.\r\n23. Which one of the following best expresses the main idea\r\nof the passage?\r\n(A) In The Dynamics of Apocalypse, John Lowe\r\nsuccessfully proves that the collapse of Classic\r\nMayan civilization was set in motion by\r\nincreasing population and decreasing\r\nproductivity.\r\n(B) In The Dynamics of Apocalypse, John Lowe breaks\r\nnew ground in solving the mystery of the\r\ncollapse of Classic Mayan civilization through\r\nhis use of dated monuments to create a step-by-\r\nstep account of the collapse.\r\n(C) In The Dynamics of Apocalypse, John Lowe\r\nsuccessfully uses existing data to document the\r\nreduction and then cessation of new construction\r\nthroughout Classic Mayan civilization.\r\n(D) Although John Lowe’s study is based on a careful\r\nexamination of the historical record, it does not\r\naccurately reflect the circumstances surrounding\r\nthe collapse of Classic Mayan civilization.\r\n(E) While John Lowe’s theory about the collapse of\r\nClassic Mayan civilization appears credible, it is\r\nbased on an assumption that cannot be verified\r\nusing the archaeological record.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n24. Which one of the following is most closely analogous to\r\nthe assumption Lowe makes about the relationship\r\nbetween monument construction and Classic Mayan\r\ncities?\r\n(A) A person assumes that the shortage of fresh\r\nproduce on the shelves of a grocery store is due\r\nto the effects of poor weather conditions\r\nduring the growing season.\r\n(B) A person assumes that a movie theater only\r\nshows foreign films because the titles of the\r\nfilms shown there are not familiar to the\r\nperson.\r\n(C) A person assumes that a restaurant is under new\r\nownership because the restaurant’s menu has\r\nchanged drastically since the last time the person\r\nate there.\r\n(D) A person assumes that a corporation has been\r\nsold because there is a new name for the\r\ncorporation on the sign outside the building\r\nwhere the company is located.\r\n(E) A person assumes a friend has sold her stamp\r\ncollection because the friend has stopped\r\npurchasing new stamps.\r\n25. It can be inferred from the passage that the author would\r\ndescribe the method Lowe used to construct a step-by-\r\nstep chronology of the actual collapse of Classic\r\nMayan civilization as\r\n(A) daringly innovative but flawed\r\n(B) generally accepted but questionable\r\n(C) very reliable but outdated\r\n(D) unscientific but effective\r\n(E) unconventional but brilliant\r\n26. The author of the passage would most likely\r\nagree with which one of the following\r\nstatements about the use of the archaeological record\r\nto reconstruct historic activity?\r\n(A) With careful analysis, archaeological evidence\r\ncan be used to reconstruct accurately the historic\r\nactivity of a past civilization.\r\n(B) Archaeological evidence is more useful for\r\nreconstructing the day-to-day activities of a\r\nculture than its long-term trends.\r\n(C) The accuracy of the archaeological record for\r\nreconstructing historic activity is dependent on\r\nthe duration of the particular civilization.\r\n(D) The archaeological record is not an appropriate\r\nsource of data for reconstructing historic\r\nactivity.\r\n(E) Historic activity can be reconstructed from\r\narchaeological evidence, but it is ultimately\r\nimpossible to confirm the accuracy of the\r\nreconstruction.\r\n103\r\nSTOP\r\nIF YOU FINISH BEFORE TIME IS CALLED, YOU MAY CHECK YOUR WORK ON THIS SECTION ONLY.\r\nDO NOT WORK ON ANY OTHER SECTION IN THE TEST.\r\n104\r\nSECTION III\r\nTime—35 minutes\r\n24 Questions\r\nDirections: Each group of questions in this section is based on a set of conditions.

For some\r\nquestions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that\r\nis, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by\r\ncommonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best an-\r\nswer, blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.\r\n1. Critic: People today place an especially high\r\nvalue on respect for others; yet, in their comedy\r\nacts, many of today’s most popular comedians\r\ndisplay blatant disrespect for others. But when\r\npeople fail to live up to the very ideals they hold\r\nin highest esteem, exaggeration of such failings\r\noften forms the basis of successful comedy. Thus\r\nthe current popularity of comedians who display\r\ndisrespect in their acts is hardly surprising.\r\nThe critic’s argument depends on which one of the\r\nfollowing assumptions?\r\n(A) People who enjoy comedians who display\r\ndisrespect in their acts do not place a high value\r\non respect for others.\r\n(B) Only comedians who display blatant disrespect in\r\ntheir acts are currently successful.\r\n(C) Many people disapprove of the portrayal of\r\nblatant disrespect for others in comedy acts.\r\n(D) People who value an ideal especially highly do\r\nnot always succeed in living up to this ideal.\r\n(E) People today fail to live up to their own ideals\r\nmore frequently than was the case in the past.\r\n2. The law firm of Sutherlin, Pérez, and Associates is one\r\nof the most successful law firms whose primary\r\nspecialization is in criminal defense cases. In fact, the\r\nfirm has a better than 90 percent acquittal rate in such\r\ncases. Dalton is an attorney whose primary specialization\r\nis in divorce cases, so Dalton certainly cannot be a\r\nmember of Sutherlin, Pérez, and Associates.\r\nThe reasoning in the argument is flawed because\r\nthe argument\r\n(A) offers in support of its conclusion pieces of\r\nevidence that are mutually contradictory\r\n(B) overlooks the possibility that a person can\r\npractice law without being a member of a law\r\nfirm\r\n(C) concludes that someone is not a member of a\r\ngroup on the grounds that that person does not\r\nhave a characteristic that the group as a whole\r\nhas\r\n(D) takes a high rate of success among the members\r\nof a group to indicate that the successes are\r\nevenly spread among the members\r\n(E) states a generalization based on a selection that is\r\nnot representative of the group about which the\r\ngeneralization is supposed to hold true\r\n3. Opponents of allowing triple-trailer trucks to use the\r\nnational highway system are wrong in claiming that\r\nthese trucks are more dangerous than other commercial\r\nvehicles. In the western part of the country, in areas\r\nwhere triple-trailers are now permitted on some\r\nhighways, for these vehicles the rate of road accident\r\nfatalities per mile of travel is lower than the national\r\nrate for other types of commercial vehicles. Clearly, triple-\r\ntrailers are safer than other commercial vehicles.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most substantially\r\nweakens the argument?\r\n(A) It takes two smaller semitrailers to haul as much\r\nweight as a single triple-trailer can.\r\n(B) Highways in the sparsely populated West are\r\nmuch less heavily traveled and consequently are\r\nfar safer than highways in the national system as\r\na whole.\r\n(C) Opponents of the triple-trailers also once opposed\r\nthe shorter twin-trailers, which are now common\r\non the nation’s highways.\r\n(D) In areas where the triple-trailers are permitted,\r\ndrivers need a special license to operate them.\r\n(E) For triple-trailers the rate of road accident\r\nfatalities per mile of travel was higher last year\r\nthan in the two previous years.\r\n4. Whittaker: There can be no such thing as the number\r\nof medical school students who drop out before\r\ntheir second year, because if they drop out, they\r\nnever have a second year.\r\nHudson: By your reasoning I cannot help but become\r\nrich, because there is similarly no such thing as my\r\ndying before my first million dollars is in the bank.\r\nHudson responds to Whittaker by\r\n(A) showing that a relevantly analogous argument\r\nleads to an untenable conclusion\r\n(B) citing a specific example to counter Whittaker’s\r\ngeneral claim\r\n(C) pointing out that Whittaker mistakes a\r\nnecessary situation for a possible situation\r\n(D) claiming that what Whittaker says cannot be true\r\nbecause Whittaker acts as if it were false\r\n(E) showing that Whittaker’s argument relies on\r\nanalyzing an extreme and unrepresentative case\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n109\r\n5. A newly developed light bulb is much more cost-\r\neffective than conventional light bulbs: it costs only\r\nabout 3 times what a conventional light bulb costs but it\r\nlasts up to 10 times as long as a conventional light bulb.\r\nDespite the manufacturer’s intense efforts to publicize\r\nthe advantages of the new bulb, one analyst predicts that\r\nthese new bulbs will prove to sell very poorly.\r\nEach of the following, if true, provides support for\r\nthe analyst’s prediction EXCEPT:\r\n(A) The light generated by the new bulb is in the\r\nyellow range of the spectrum, a type of artificial\r\nlight most people find unappealing.\r\n(B) Most people who purchase light bulbs prefer to\r\nbuy inexpensive light bulbs rather than more\r\ndurable but expensive light bulbs.\r\n(C) A manufacturer of one brand of conventional\r\nlight bulb has advertised claims that the new\r\nlight bulb uses more electricity than do\r\nconventional light bulbs.\r\n(D) The new bulb is to be marketed in several\r\ndifferent quantities, ranging from packages\r\ncontaining one bulb to packages containing four\r\nbulbs.\r\n(E) A competing manufacturer is about to introduce a\r\nlight bulb that lasts 10 times as long as a\r\nconventional bulb but costs less than a\r\nconventional bulb.\r\n6. The Rienzi, a passenger ship, sank as a result of a hole\r\nin its hull, possibly caused by sabotage. Normally, when\r\na holed ship sinks as rapidly as the Rienzi did, water does\r\nnot enter the ship quickly enough for the ship to be fully\r\nflooded when it reaches the ocean floor. Full flooding\r\ncan be achieved, however, by sabotage. Any ship that\r\nsinks deep into the ocean when not fully flooded will\r\nimplode. Deep-sea photographs, taken of the sunken\r\nRienzi where it rests on the ocean floor, reveal that the\r\nRienzi did not implode.\r\nWhich one of the following must be true on the basis of\r\nthe information above?\r\n(A) The Rienzi was so constructed as to reduce the\r\nrisk of sinking by impact.\r\n(B) If the Rienzi became fully flooded, it did so only\r\nafter it reached the ocean floor.\r\n(C) If the Rienzi was not sunk by sabotage, water\r\nflooded into it unusually fast.\r\n(D) If the Rienzi had sunk more slowly, it would have\r\nimploded.\r\n(E) The Rienzi was so strongly constructed as to resist\r\nimploding under deep-sea pressure.\r\n7. For every 50 dogs that contract a certain disease, one\r\nwill die from it. A vaccine exists that is virtually\r\n100 percent effective in preventing this disease. Since\r\nthe risk of death from complications of vaccination is\r\none death per 5,000 vaccinations, it is therefore safer for\r\na dog to receive the vaccine than not to receive it.\r\nWhich one of the following would it be most helpful\r\nto know in order to evaluate the argument?\r\n(A) the total number of dogs that die each year from\r\nall causes taken together\r\n(B) whether the vaccine is effective against the\r\ndisease in household pets other than dogs\r\n(C) the number of dogs that die each year from\r\ndiseases other than the disease in question\r\n(D) the likelihood that a dog will contract another\r\ndisease such as rabies\r\n(E) the likelihood that an unvaccinated dog will\r\ncontract the disease in question\r\n8. The symptoms of mental disorders are behavioral,\r\ncognitive, or emotional problems. Some patients with\r\nmental disorders can be effectively treated with\r\npsychotherapy. But it is now known that in some patients\r\nmental disorders result from chemical imbalances\r\naffecting the brain. Thus these patients can be\r\neffectively treated only with medication that will reduce\r\nor correct the imbalance.\r\nThe argument depends on assuming which one of the\r\nfollowing?\r\n(A) Treatment by psychotherapy can produce no\r\neffective reduction in or correction of chemical\r\nimbalances that cause mental disorders.\r\n(B) Treatment with medication always shows faster\r\nresults for patients with mental disorders than\r\ndoes treatment with psychotherapy.\r\n(C) Most mental disorders are not the result of\r\nchemical imbalances affecting the brain.\r\n(D) Medication is always more effective in treating\r\npatients with mental disorders than is\r\npsychotherapy.\r\n(E) Treatment with psychotherapy has no effect on\r\nmental disorders other than a reduction of the\r\nsymptoms.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\nQuestions 9–10\r\nCurator: The decision to restore the cloak of the central\r\nfigure in Veronese’s painting from its present red to\r\nthe green found underneath is fully justified.\r\nReliable x-ray and chemical tests show that the red\r\npigment was applied after the painting had been\r\ncompleted, and that the red paint was not mixed in\r\nVeronese’s workshop. Hence it appears likely that an\r\nartist other than Veronese tampered with Veronese’s\r\npainting after its completion.\r\nArt critic: But in a copy of Veronese’s painting made shortly\r\nafter Veronese died, the cloak is red. It is highly\r\nunlikely that a copyist would have made so major\r\na change so soon after Veronese’s death.\r\n9. The assertion that a later artist tampered with Veronese’s\r\npainting serves which one of the following functions in\r\nthe curator’s argument?\r\n(A) It is the main point toward which the argument as\r\na whole is directed.\r\n(B) It is a subsidiary conclusion that supports the\r\nargument’s main conclusion.\r\n(C) It is a clarification of a key term of the argument.\r\n(D) It is a particular instance of the general position to\r\nbe defended.\r\n(E) It is a reiteration of the main point that is made\r\nfor the sake of emphasis.\r\n10. The art critic’s response to the curator would provide the\r\nstrongest support for which one of the following\r\nconclusions?\r\n(A) The copy of Veronese’s painting that was made\r\nsoon after the painter’s death is indistinguishable\r\nfrom the original.\r\n(B) No painting should be restored before the\r\npainting is tested with technologically\r\nsophisticated equipment.\r\n(C) The proposed restoration will fail to restore\r\nVeronese’s painting to the appearance it had at\r\nthe end of the artist’s lifetime.\r\n(D) The value of an artist’s work is not necessarily\r\ncompromised when that work is tampered with\r\nby later artists.\r\n(E) Veronese did not originally intend the central\r\nfigure’s cloak to be green.\r\n11. John works five days each week except when on\r\nvacation or during weeks in which national holidays\r\noccur. Four days a week he works in an insurance\r\ncompany; on Fridays he works as a blacksmith. Last\r\nweek there were no holidays, and John was not on\r\nvacation. Therefore, he must have worked in the\r\ninsurance company on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\r\nand Thursday last week.\r\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which\r\nthe argument depends?\r\n(A) John never takes a vacation of more than one\r\nweek in length.\r\n(B) Every day last week that John worked, he worked\r\nfor an entire workday.\r\n(C) John does not take vacations in weeks in which\r\nnational holidays occur.\r\n(D) Last week John worked neither on Saturday nor\r\non Sunday.\r\n(E) There were no days last week on which John both\r\nworked in the insurance company and also\r\nworked as a blacksmith.\r\n12. After several attempts to distract his young parrot\r\nfrom chewing on furniture, George reluctantly took an\r\nexpert’s advice and gently hit the parrot’s beak whenever\r\nthe bird started to chew furniture. The bird stopped\r\nchewing furniture, but it is now afraid of hands and will\r\nsometimes bite. Since chewing on the furniture would\r\nnot have hurt the bird, George should not have hit it.\r\nWhen Carla’s puppy escaped from her yard, it bounded\r\ninto a busy street. Although Carla does not generally\r\napprove of physical discipline, she hit the puppy sharply\r\nwith her hand. Now the puppy enters the street only\r\nwhen accompanied by Carla, so Carla was justified in\r\ndisciplining the puppy.\r\nWhich one of the following principles, if established,\r\nwould justify the judgments about George’s and Carla’s\r\nactions?\r\n(A) When disciplining an animal physically, a trainer\r\nshould use an object such as a rolled up\r\nnewspaper to avoid making the animal\r\nfrightened of hands.\r\n(B) When training an animal, physical discipline\r\nshould be used only when such discipline is\r\nnecessary to correct behavior that could result in\r\nserious harm to the animal.\r\n(C) Using physical discipline to train an animal is\r\njustified only when all alternative strategies for\r\ncorrecting undesirable behavior have failed.\r\n(D) Physical discipline should not be used on\r\nimmature animals.\r\n(E) Physical discipline should not be used by an\r\nanimal trainer except to correct persistent\r\nbehavior problems.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n110\r\n111\r\n13. Mature white pines intercept almost all the sunlight\r\nthat shines on them. They leave a deep litter that\r\ndries readily, and they grow to prodigious height so\r\nthat, even when there are large gaps in a stand of\r\nsuch trees, little light reaches the forest floor. For this\r\nreason white pines cannot regenerate in their own\r\nshade. Thus, when in a dense forest a stand of trees\r\nconsists of nothing but mature white pines, it is a fair\r\nbet that ____.\r\nWhich one of the following most logically concludes\r\nthe argument?\r\n(A) the ages of the trees in the stand do not differ\r\nfrom each other by much more than the length\r\nof time it takes a white pine to grow to\r\nmaturity\r\n(B) the land on which the stand is now growing had\r\nbeen cleared of all trees at the time when the\r\nfirst of the white pines started growing\r\n(C) competition among the trees in the stand for\r\nsunlight will soon result in some trees’ dying\r\nand the stand thus becoming thinner\r\n(D) other species of trees will soon begin to colonize\r\nthe stand, eventually replacing all of the white\r\npines\r\n(E) any differences in the heights of the trees in the\r\nstand are attributable solely to differences in\r\nthe ages of the trees\r\n14. Advertisement: A leading economist has determined\r\nthat among people who used computers at their\r\nplace of employment last year, those who also\r\nowned portable (”laptop”) computers earned\r\n25 percent more on average than those who did\r\nnot. It is obvious from this that owning a laptop\r\ncomputer led to a higher-paying job.\r\nWhich one of the following identifies a reasoning\r\nerror in the argument?\r\n(A) It attempts to support a sweeping generalization\r\non the basis of information about only a small\r\nnumber of individuals.\r\n(B) Its conclusion merely restates a claim made\r\nearlier in the argument.\r\n(C) It concludes that one thing was caused by another\r\nalthough the evidence given is consistent with\r\nthe first thing’s having caused the second.\r\n(D) It offers information as support for a conclusion\r\nwhen that information actually shows that the\r\nconclusion is false.\r\n(E) It uncritically projects currently existing trends\r\nindefinitely into the future.\r\n15. Rhonda will see the movie tomorrow afternoon only if\r\nPaul goes to the concert in the afternoon. Paul will not\r\ngo to the concert unless Ted agrees to go to the concert.\r\nHowever, Ted refuses to go to the concert. So Rhonda\r\nwill not see the movie tomorrow afternoon.\r\nThe pattern of reasoning displayed above is most closely\r\nparalleled in which one of the following?\r\n(A) If Janice comes to visit, Mary will not pay the\r\nbills tomorrow. Janice will not come to visit\r\nunless she locates a babysitter. However, Janice\r\nhas located a babysitter, so she will visit Mary.\r\n(B) Gary will do his laundry tomorrow only if Peter\r\nhas to go to work. Unless Cathy is ill, Peter will\r\nnot have to go to work. Since Cathy is not ill,\r\nGary will not do his laundry tomorrow.\r\n(C) Kelly will barbecue fish tonight if it does not rain\r\nand the market has fresh trout. Although the\r\nforecast does not call for rain, the market does\r\nnot have fresh trout. So Kelly will not barbecue\r\nfish tonight.\r\n(D) Lisa will attend the family reunion next week\r\nonly if one of her brothers, Jared or Karl, also\r\nattends. Karl will not attend the reunion, but\r\nJared will. So Lisa will attend the reunion.\r\n(E) George will not go to the museum tomorrow\r\nunless Mark agrees to go. Mark will go to the\r\nmuseum only if he can postpone most of his\r\nappointments. Mark has postponed some of his\r\nappointments, so he will go to the museum.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n16. Private industry is trying to attract skilled research\r\nscientists by offering them high salaries. As a result,\r\nmost research scientists employed in private industry\r\nnow earn 50 percent more than do comparably skilled\r\nresearch scientists employed by the government. So,\r\nunless government-employed research scientists are\r\nmotivated more by a sense of public duty than by their\r\nown interests, the government is likely to lose its most\r\nskilled research scientists to private industry, since none\r\nof these scientists would have problems finding private-\r\nsector jobs.\r\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which\r\nthe argument depends?\r\n(A) Government research scientists are less likely to\r\nreceive acknowledgment for their research\r\ncontributions than are research scientists in the\r\nprivate sector.\r\n(B) None of the research scientists currently\r\nemployed by the government earns more than\r\nthe highest-paid researchers employed in the\r\nprivate sector.\r\n(C) The government does not employ as many\r\nresearch scientists who are highly skilled as does\r\nany large company in the private sector which\r\nemploys research scientists.\r\n(D) The government does not provide its research\r\nscientists with unusually good working\r\nconditions or fringe benefits that more than\r\ncompensate for the lower salaries they receive.\r\n(E) Research scientists employed in the private sector\r\ngenerally work longer hours than do researchers\r\nemployed by the government.\r\n17. Using fossil energy more efficiently is in the interest\r\nof the nation and the global environment, but major\r\nimprovements are unlikely unless proposed\r\ngovernment standards are implemented to eliminate\r\nproducts or practices that are among the least\r\nefficient in their class.\r\nObjection: Decisions on energy use are best left to the\r\noperation of the market.\r\nWhich one of the following, if true, most directly\r\nundermines the objection above?\r\n(A) It would be unrealistic to expect society to make\r\nthe changes necessary to achieve maximum\r\nenergy efficiency all at once.\r\n(B) There are products, such as automobiles, that\r\nconsume energy at a sufficient rate that persons\r\nwho purchase and use them will become\r\nconscious of any unusual energy inefficiency in\r\ncomparison with other products in the same\r\nclass.\r\n(C) Whenever a new mode of generating energy, such\r\nas a new fuel, is introduced, a number of support\r\nsystems, such as a fuel-distribution system, must\r\nbe created or adapted.\r\n(D) When energy prices rise, consumers of energy\r\ntend to look for new ways to increase energy\r\nefficiency, such as by adding insulation to their\r\nhouses.\r\n(E) Often the purchaser of a product, such as a\r\nlandlord buying an appliance, chooses on the\r\nbasis of purchase price because the purchaser is\r\nnot the person who will pay for energy used by\r\nthe product.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n112\r\n113\r\n18. Dobson: Some historians claim that the people\r\nwho built a ring of stones thousands of years ago\r\nin Britain were knowledgeable about celestial\r\nevents. The ground for this claim is that two of the\r\nstones determine a line pointing directly to the\r\nposition of the sun at sunrise at the spring\r\nequinox. There are many stones in the ring,\r\nhowever, so the chance that one pair will point in\r\na celestially significant direction is large.\r\nTherefore, the people who built the ring were not\r\nknowledgeable about celestial events.\r\nWhich one of the following is an error of reasoning\r\nin Dobson’s argument?\r\n(A) The failure of cited evidence to establish a\r\nstatement is taken as evidence that that\r\nstatement is false.\r\n(B) Dobson’s conclusion logically contradicts some\r\nof the evidence presented in support of it.\r\n(C) Statements that absolutely establish Dobson’s\r\nconclusion are treated as if they merely give\r\nsome support to that conclusion.\r\n(D) Something that is merely a matter of opinion is\r\ntreated as if it were subject to verification as a\r\nmatter of fact.\r\n(E) Dobson’s drawing the conclusion relies on\r\ninterpreting a key term in two different ways.\r\n19. Nearly all mail that is correctly addressed arrives at its\r\ndestination within two business days of being sent. In\r\nfact, correctly addressed mail takes longer than this only\r\nwhen it is damaged in transit. Overall, however, most\r\nmail arrives three business days or more after being sent.\r\nIf the statements above are true, which one of the\r\nfollowing must be true?\r\n(A) A large proportion of the mail that is correctly\r\naddressed is damaged in transit.\r\n(B) No incorrectly addressed mail arrives within two\r\nbusiness days of being sent.\r\n(C) Most mail that arrives within two business days\r\nof being sent is correctly addressed.\r\n(D) A large proportion of mail is incorrectly\r\naddressed.\r\n(E) More mail arrives within two business days of\r\nbeing sent than arrives between two and three\r\nbusiness days after being sent.\r\n20. The report released by the interior ministry states\r\nthat within the past 5 years the national land-\r\nreclamation program has resulted in a 19 percent\r\nincrease in the amount of arable land within the\r\ncountry. If these figures are accurate, the program has\r\nbeen a resounding success. Senator Armand, a\r\ndistinguished mathematician and a woman of\r\nindisputable brilliance, maintains, however, that the\r\nreclamation program could not possibly have been\r\nsuccessful. Clearly, therefore, the figures cited in the\r\nreport cannot be accurate.\r\nThe argument above exhibits an erroneous pattern\r\nof reasoning most similar to that exhibited by which\r\none of the following?\r\n(A) Albert’s father claims that Albert does not know\r\nwhere the spare car keys are hidden.\r\nYesterday, however, Albert reported that he\r\nhad discovered the spare car keys in the\r\ngarage toolbox, so his father’s claim cannot be\r\ntrue.\r\n(B) Gloria’s drama teacher claims that her policy is\r\nto give each student the opportunity to act in\r\nat least one play during the year but, since\r\nGloria, who attended every class, reports that\r\nshe was not given such an opportunity, the\r\nteacher’s claim cannot be true.\r\n(C) Amos claims that he can hold his breath under\r\nwater for a full hour. Dr. Treviso, a\r\ncardiopulmonary specialist, has stated that\r\nhumans are physiologically incapable of\r\nholding their breath for even half that long; so\r\nAmos’ claim cannot be true.\r\n(D) Evelyn reports that she got home before\r\nmidnight. Robert, who always knows the time,\r\ninsists that she did not. If Robert is right,\r\nEvelyn could not possibly have listened to the\r\nlate news; since she admits not having listened\r\nto the late news, her report cannot be true.\r\n(E) Moira, after observing the finish of the\r\n60-kilometer bicycle race, reports that Lee won\r\nwith Adams a distant third. Lomas, a bicycle\r\nengineering expert, insists, however, that Lee\r\ncould not have won a race in which Adams\r\ncompeted; so Moira’s report cannot be true.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n114\r\nQuestions 21–22\r\nWirth: All efforts to identify a gene responsible for\r\npredisposing people to manic-depression have\r\nfailed. In fact, nearly all researchers now agree\r\nthat there is no “manic-depression gene.”\r\nTherefore, if these researchers are right, any claim\r\nthat some people are genetically predisposed to\r\nmanic-depression is simply false.\r\nChang: I do not dispute your evidence, but I take\r\nissue with your conclusion. Many of the\r\nresearchers you refer to have found evidence that\r\na set of several genes is involved and that\r\ncomplex interactions among these genes produce\r\na predisposition to manic-depression.\r\n21. The point at issue between Wirth and Chang is whether\r\n(A) efforts to identify a gene or set of several genes\r\nresponsible for predisposing people to\r\nmanic-depression have all failed\r\n(B) it is likely that researchers will ever be able to\r\nfind a single gene that predisposes people to\r\nmanic-depression\r\n(C) nearly all researchers now agree that there is no\r\nmanic-depression gene\r\n(D) current research supports the claim that no one\r\nis genetically predisposed to manic-depression\r\n(E) the efforts made to find a gene that can produce\r\na predisposition to manic-depression were\r\nthorough\r\n22. Which one of the following most accurately expresses\r\nChang’s criticism of Wirth’s argument?\r\n(A) It presupposes only one possibility where more\r\nthan one exists.\r\n(B) It depends on separate pieces of evidence that\r\ncontradict each other.\r\n(C) It relies on the opinion of experts in an area\r\noutside the experts’ field of expertise.\r\n(D) It disallows in principle any evidence that\r\nwould disconfirm its conclusion.\r\n(E) It treats something that is merely unlikely as\r\nthough it were impossible.\r\n23. Garbage dumps do not harm wildlife. Evidence is\r\nfurnished by the Masai-Mara reserve in Kenya,\r\nwhere baboons that use the garbage dumps on the\r\nreserve as a food source mature faster and have more\r\noffspring than do baboons on the reserve that do not\r\nscavenge on garbage.\r\nEach of the following statements, if true, casts doubt\r\non the argument EXCEPT:\r\n(A) The baboons that feed on the garbage dump are\r\nof a different species from those that do not.\r\n(B) The life expectancy of baboons that eat garbage\r\nis significantly lower than that of baboons that\r\ndo not eat garbage.\r\n(C) The cholesterol level of garbage-eating baboons\r\nis dangerously higher than that of baboons\r\nthat do not eat garbage.\r\n(D) The population of hyenas that live near\r\nunregulated garbage landfills north of the\r\nreserve has doubled in the last two years.\r\n(E) The rate of birth defects for the baboon\r\npopulation on the reserve has doubled since\r\nthe first landfills were opened.\r\nGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.\r\n115\r\nQuestions 24–25\r\nMarianne is a professional chess player who hums audibly\r\nwhile playing her matches, thereby distracting her opponents.\r\nWhen ordered by chess officials to cease humming or else\r\nbe disqualified from professional chess, Marianne protested\r\nthe order. She argued that since she was unaware of her\r\nhumming, her humming was involuntary and that\r\ntherefore she should not be held responsible for it.\r\n24. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most\r\nhelps to support Marianne’s argument against the\r\norder?\r\n(A) Chess players who hum audibly while playing\r\ntheir matches should not protest if their\r\nopponents also hum.\r\n(B) Of a player’s actions, only those that are\r\nvoluntary should be used as justification for\r\ndisqualifying that player from professional\r\nchess.\r\n(C) A person should be held responsible for those\r\ninvoluntary actions that serve that person’s\r\ninterests.\r\n(D) Types of behavior that are not considered\r\nvoluntary in everyday circumstances should\r\nbe considered voluntary if they occur in the\r\ncontext of a professional chess match.\r\n(E) Chess players should be disqualified from\r\nprofessional chess matches if they regularly\r\nattempt to distract their opponents.\r\n25. Which one of the following, if true, most undermines\r\nMarianne’s argument against the order?\r\n(A) The officials of chess have little or no authority\r\nto control the behavior of its professional\r\nplayers outside of matches.\r\n(B) Many of the customs of amateur chess matches\r\nare not observed by professional chess players.\r\n(C) Not all of a person’s involuntary actions are\r\nactions of which that person is unaware.\r\n(D) A person who hums involuntarily can easily\r\nlearn to notice it and can thereby come to\r\ncontrol it.\r\n(E) Not all of Marianne’s opponents are distracted\r\nby her humming during chess matches.\r\n26. Smoking in bed has long been the main cause of\r\nhome fires. Despite a significant decline in cigarette\r\nsmoking in the last two decades, however, there has\r\nbeen no comparable decline in the number of people\r\nkilled in home fires.\r\nEach one of the following statements, if true over\r\nthe last two decades, helps to resolve the apparent\r\ndiscrepancy above EXCEPT:\r\n(A) Compared to other types of home fires, home\r\nfires caused by smoking in bed usually cause\r\nrelatively little damage before they are\r\nextinguished.\r\n(B) Home fires caused by smoking in bed often\r\nbreak out after the home’s occupants have\r\nfallen asleep.\r\n(C) Smokers who smoke in bed tend to be heavy\r\nsmokers who are less likely to quit smoking\r\nthan are smokers who do not smoke in bed.\r\n(D) An increasing number of people have been\r\nkilled in home fires that started in the kitchen.\r\n(E) Population densities have increased, with the\r\nresult that one home fire can cause more\r\ndeaths than in previous decades.\r\nSTOP\r\nIF YOU FINISH BEFORE TIME IS CALLED, YOU MAY CHECK YOUR WORK ON THIS SECTION ONLY.\r\nDO NOT WORK ON ANY OTHER SECTION IN THE TEST.\r\nAnswer Sheet\r\nAnswer Sheet\r\nAnswer Key for the Sample Test\r\n118\r\nSECTION I\r\n1.

B\r\nThe Sample Test\r\n119\r\nLSAT Writing Sample Topic\r\nRoberto Martinez, owner of a small used bookstore, has recently purchased an adjacent store and is deciding how best to use it to expand his business. Write an\r\nargument in support of one plan over the other based on the following criteria:\r\nc108 Martinez wants to attract a significant number of new customers.\r\nc108 Martinez wants to retain the loyal clientele who look to him for out-of-print books and first editions.\r\nOne plan is for Martinez to begin carrying best-sellers and popular fiction. Because of his downtown location, publishers of these works are likely to put his store on\r\ntheir book tours; although the large bookstore chains have taken hold in the suburbs, none has yet located in the downtown area. Under this plan, however, Martinez would\r\nhave enough room to keep only the best books from his current inventory. To capitalize on this collection, he is considering an occasional evening series called “Rediscoveries,”\r\nfeaturing discussions of authors whose out-of-print books he carries, particularly several authors who are currently enjoying a resurgence of critical attention.\r\nAn alternative plan is for Martinez to use the new space to open a small coffeehouse with a limited menu. He would furnish the area as a sitting room with couches\r\nand chairs and a few regular dining tables. Although there are several restaurants nearby, they offer primarily full meals in more formal settings. Retaining much of his\r\ninventory of used books, he would add novels, poetry, and nonfiction published by small presses to feature lesser-known writers whose work is difficult to find in this\r\ncommunity. These small presses include a number of local authors who are eager to read and discuss their work in the coffeehouse.\r\nSIGNATURE ______________________________________________\r\nDATE\r\nComputing Your Score\r\nDirections:\r\n1.
